1) Is it currently not possible to copy and paste commands in R from the online pdf version on github > Suggest to change to an HTML format
2) To install packages from github I believe that the syntax should be: `devtools::install_github('nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr ')` not `devtools::install_github('nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr', repos = NULL, type = 'source')` which gave erros. The same thing applies to the `RxODE`.
3) For `RxODE` I got the following error even though I have gfortran (v.6.1) installed.
```

4) I just came to realize that `RxODE` is now available on CRAN and this should be mentioned in the instructions it would prevent the installation issues.","guiastrennec",1,0

For instance, when using Microsoft R Open with nlmixr, there is the possibility of setting up a temporary cluster and running nlme jobs in parallel, like with the following syntax:

```
library(doParallel)
library(foreach)

cl <- makeCluster(15)
registerDoParallel(cl)

When you try to do something like that with SAEM, it crashes immediately, because a single dll is generated in the run directory that is then shared (?): nlme runs create temporary directories that store the material, but SAEM does not. It would be extremely useful if these processes were separated.

Although it is nice that the dll is persistent so it can be reused for new data with the same model, it would be much nicer if the dll can be referenced explicitly (like with nlme) and put in a separate subdirectory instead of being created in the run directory.

Naturally, as far as possible, because the different algorithms may build on different R packages: nlme for instance has its very well developed syntax that you would want to keep  being accessible, but some harmonisation should definitely be possible.

For instance: nlme requires parameters to be estimated in the log domain, a natural choice because it allows IIV to be implemented as additive on the log-scale corresponding to exponential-type IIV estimates. And while the SAEM module does basically the same, here parameter are specified on the original scale and are log-transformed internally.

A suggestion would be:
-syntax to generate a compiled model with associated handle (e.g. m1)
-standard syntax to define parameter transformations
-standard syntax to provide inter-individual variability models
-standard syntax to describe residual variability models
-standard syntax to provide starting values
-standard syntax to start a model fit

Would it be an option to use exisiting nlme model definition as a starting point for this? It is well established syntax and it is probably easier to adapt new implementations to the exisiting standard than to try to adapt nlme syntax to newly developed conventions... ","RikSchoemaker",267,0

Instead if I switch mypar with something like following, it works and gives me reliable estimates.

Error in nlme.formula(model = DV ~ (nlmeModList(""user_fn""))(lCL, eta_CL,  :

Any ideas on these issues? First one seems some matrix definiteness issue perhaps? But second one occurs also with diagonal block.
 
Thanks!

Saw NLMIXR was now on CRAN. Tested the source version on Linux (R3.4.1) and Windows and the binary version on Windows in R3.3.3 and 3.4.1.

None of the versions worked on my machines and on my example. I had a self compiled version previously which worked nicely on all my NLMIXR examples ... bit weird ... especially as it had the same version number as the one on CRAN now. 

Example available here: http://web.intiquan.com/Stuff/NLMIXR/exampleNLMIXR.zip

Cheers,

I was following along in ""Installation on Windows"" (https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr) and things were basically working okay, although there were a few unit tests that failed (after a long time) in Step 6 (Install RxODE), last sub-step.  Then at Step 7, to actually install nlmixr, the other packages got installed fine, but nlmixr compilation failed.  I do not know why.

I pasted the output for Steps 1-6 in its own file (which is relatively big because of all the testing in Step 6), and the problematic Step 7 in its own file, both attached.

By the way, as for the Windows installer, it installs its own version of R and was invisible to the version of R I already had running just fine seen by RStudio, so I uninstalled all that prior to following the steps in ""Installation on Windows"".

As I think my nlmixr is properly running as far as I can tell (as I just posted in Issue #25), I think that there are two other issues with the ""Running PK models with nlmixr"" tutorial at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlmixr/vignettes/running_nlmixr.html which need addressing.  Following along with the first fit with the nlme algorithm, the numbers are different (between what I get and what's in the tutorial) but the differences are small, so that may be a bit irksome but isn't too disconcerting.  However, with the SAEM algorithm, the differences are substantial, as I reported a few weeks ago (but maybe the emphasis was lost with other things).  For example, in the tutorial the objective function value was 116.211 and the log likelihood was -58.1055, whereas I got OBJF = 349.6266 and log-likelihood = -174.8133 respectively.  I did set.seed() to two different values but seem to have gotten the same results both times.  Also, the plot should be unimodal for the theophylline data, but it's bimodal because somehow other data were included at a much later time.  (The theophylline data should only go up to about 25 hours, not 150.)  Here's the pasted output for the plot; there is a problem here somehow—DV shouldn't be lost:

> plot(fit.saem)

I've read the nlmixr documentation fairly carefully but it's not yet clear to me how best to do this.  I assume that this should be controlled by an option in nlmeControl or saemControl (but only the latter has an entry in the documentation [let's call this sub-issue 1]).  In the Package 'nlmixr' documentation (2017-11-09) under gnlmm, in the Examples section, there is this line:

```
fit = gnlmm(llik, pump, inits,
control=list(
reltol.outer=1e-4,
optim.outer=""nmsimplex"",
nAQD=5
)
)

What does nAQD control?  [sub-issue 2] It would be nice to have some discussion or reference to the control parameters.

Would something like this be suitable for getting only the initial objective function value or log-likelihood?

```R
fit <- nlmixr(one.compartment.model, data, est=""nlme"",
              control = nlmeControl(maxIter = 1, pnlsMaxIter = 1, msMaxIter = 1))

At the end of Issue #29 you wrote that you couldn't get the small object x to appear.  (x is a 1 x 1 matrix.)  Instead of continuing that issue, which you marked as closed, I thought it would be better to open a new one for it.  To get the object to appear, start with a new folder that is empty, do a fit, close RStudio session, and then go back to that same folder (which now won't be empty) and repeat this.  The first time you should see object x appear but the second time you shouldn't.  I attach my results that bear this out.

I made a function, funBS(), that generates bootstrapped data from a data frame that has ID as its first column.  However, when I try to use the bootstrapped data with nlmixr, I get an error and no object is created.  Note that much of this is output from what I just pasted in for Issue #28 but here is the full info.  The bootstrap part begins with funBS().  Thank-you for your help.

Instead of making this functionality a core argument, I'd propose keeping rrows quite detached from their contents and instead format row labels in the table via formatting parameters to the left most column of cells. 

Likewise, `tibbles` do not support row names, meaning that while using many tidyverse functions (which silently coerce dataframes to tibbles) to process a dataframe from which to construct an rtable, one would have to convert back to a data.frame in order to use data.frame row.names to build the table.

Often tables are used to communicate multiple types of information that my not all be described by the same headers despite all being connected by the same source of information or summarizing groups. 

Although the argument could be made for splitting this into two tables, it's often a pain to keep two separate tables consistently formatted and aligned. It can be much easier to keep them as one collective object with shared stylistic attributes. Joining the tables also communicates that they both speak to a cohesive narrative or argument.

In the spirit of accommodating that style of communication, would it be possible to extend the API to allow for multiple header rows?

(Unfortunately I still need to use NONMEM because of its MAXEVALS= 0 feature; when Issue #32 is resolved, please let me know!)  I took the AMT column at face value and got a THETA vector, no problem.  I then put this THETA vector into Madonna but used the known amount of the dose for my Madonna code, 320 mg.  The curve was way off from the data.  This was puzzling until I realized that the AMT column in the theo_sd data is wrong; the actual amount should be AMT * WT.  The AMT is really normalized by weight: if you take AMT times WT you get very close to 320 (mg) for all patients except one.  In the original experiment 12 volunteers were given a dose of 320 mg.  I don't know why patient 9 is off from that; his value of AMT*WT is 267.840 mg.

If you look at the documentation of these data just from R, ?Theoph says that the Dose column is normalized for weight, but when the Theoph dataset was made more NONMEM-like by the addition of EVID and CMT and renamed columns, apparently Dose was taken as AMT directly.

"nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr","Theophylline PK parameter estimates","https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/37","closed",2018-04-06,2018-05-07,2018-05-07,3,"Hello,
First, thank you for the terrific work in developing this package!
I’m fitting the Theophylline concentration data using _nlmixr_ and comparing the results to the ones I obtain with _saemix_ or _nlme_. The parameter estimates are similar between _saemix_ and _nlme_, but differ (too much to be due to approx. or algorithmic differences) with _nlmixr_ – see the estimates for lCl and lV in the attachment. 
I suspect it is a simple variable transformation which is too obvious for me to spot (sic), but I can’t find it. Your insights on this would be much appreciated.
Thanks a lot!

Snippet of _nlme_ code:
```R
startvec1<-c(lKa=0.5, lCl=0.75, lV=3.45)
nform<- ~(Dose*exp(lKa)*(exp(-(exp(lCl)/exp(lV))*Time)-exp(-exp(lKa)*Time)))/(exp(lV)*(exp(lKa)-(exp(lCl)/exp(lV))))
nlme.theomod<-deriv(nform, namevec=c(""lKa"", ""lCl"", ""lV""), function.arg=c(""Dose"", ""Time"", ""lKa"", ""lCl"", ""lV""))
Theo.nlme<-nlme(Concentration~nlme.theomod(Dose, Time, lKa, lCl, lV), 
                data=groupedData(Concentration~Time|Id, data=theodf), 
                fixed=list(lKa~1, lCl~1, lV~1), random=pdDiag(lKa+lCl+lV~1), start=startvec1)
```
Snippets of _nlmixr_ code:
```R
uif1 <- function() {
  ini({
    lka <- 0.45
    lCl <- 1
    lV  <- 3.45
    eta.lka ~ 0.6

Hi,

I'm wondering how to convert rtable into data.frame? 

For example, if I created a rtable like this:

```r
library(rtables)
tbl <- rtable(
  header = c(""Treatement\nN=100"", ""Comparison\nN=300""),
  format = ""xx (xx.xx%)"",
  rrow(""A"", c(104, .2), c(100, .4)),
  rrow(""B"", c(23, .4), c(43, .5)),
  rrow(),
  rrow(""this is a very long section header""),
  rrow(""estimate"", rcell(55.23, ""xx.xx"", colspan = 2)),
  rrow(""95% CI"", indent = 1, rcell(c(44.8, 67.4), format = ""(xx.x, xx.x)"", colspan = 2))
)
tbl 
##                                           Treatement        Comparison
##                                             N=100             N=300   
## ----------------------------------------------------------------------
## A                                         104 (20%)         100 (40%) 
## B                                          23 (40%)          43 (50%) 
## 
## this is a very long section header
## estimate                                             55.23

```
then how can I change tbl as data.frame format with 3 columns?

Thank you so much.

@waddella A few months back I did some tests in using this package in some of my own work. To try to move the user facing API towards a more declarative syntax, I wrote up some functions for building rtables from dataframes. 

For example, the `format` argument can accept a column name which contains format of the table for each row.

Additionally, there's handling of grouped dataframes which does automatic indenting by group.

Check out the `rtable.data.frame` and `rtable.grouped_df` functions and their examples for an idea of how this would work. There are still minor sticking points in the API that I'd like to improve, but as a whole I think it's much, much more approachable than constructing tables on a row-by-row basis. 

I know you've been recently considering more ease-of-use changes to the API and thought this early work might help add to that conversation.","dgkf",381,0

In a permeability assay I have observed concentrations in two compartments (either side of the mebrane).
I included a simple structural model with error structure for both compartments as indicated below.
```R
model({
    Q12 <- exp(tQ12)
    Q21 <- exp(tQ21)
    d/dt(Cap) = -Q12 * Cap + Q21 * Cbl
    d/dt(Cbl) =  Q12 * Cap - Q21 * Cbl
    Cap ~ prop(prop.err)
    Cbl ~ prop(prop.err)
  })
```
But following errors occur:
- with ""nlme"" :  `Error in varPower(form = ~fitted(.) | nlmixr.grp, fixed = c(1)) :   fixed parameters must have group names in 'varPower'`
- with ""saem"" : Error in nlmixrUI.saem.res.mod(obj) :   `Currently SAEM only supports one type of residual error model.`

Is it currently possible to use nlmixr with observations in 2 compartments? Or is this related to something else? Any additional thoughts?

I dont necessarily know that this it due to using SymPy rather than rSymPy, however I update anything else before this started occurring. Which leads me to two questions:
1. Is there a way to force nlmixr to search a particular directory for these files?
2. Is there a way to specify the folder location for temporary and permanent c files that are generated, similar to RxODE?

I am currently trying to fit a model and then use the .rds to simulate a different dose using RxODE. Below is the current method I am using to run the simulation.

"nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr","Error for `gen_saem_user_fn` on Unix","https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/66","closed",2018-08-08,2018-08-16,2018-08-16,3,"I have been having issues with using `gen_saem_user_fn` on a Unix server, yet could get it to work on a local Windows machine.  Upon looking into the code of this function I believe I have found the cause of the problem. 

The following code line ran on Windows as expected but raised an error when run on Unix:
 `saem_fit <- gen_saem_user_fn(model=lincmt(ncmt=1, oral=T))`

Raising the Unix error (where I have removed the exact file path):
`sh: R: command not found`
`Error in dyn.load(saem.dll) : `
  `unable to load shared object './saem5dc6774ee864.so':`
` ./saem5dc6774ee864.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`

Looking into the working directory revealed that the file created was a `.cpp` file and not the `.so` file expected, so I opened the function code to trace the problem. I found these two lines:
`shlib = sprintf(""R CMD SHLIB %s -o %s"", saem.cpp, saem.dll)` 
`system(shlib)`
These are Windows commands and do not work in Unix, yet there was no `if` statement checking the operating system at this point, hence the error. 

In addition, linking to issue #65 that I raised previously, the `plot.saemFit` function does not work in the same way on Unix and Windows, with it now working on Windows, but on Unix not plotting the same `fit` imported from Windows:
`#on Windows:`
`saem_fit <- gen_saem_user_fn(model=lincmt(ncmt=1, oral=T), trace = FALSE)`
`model <- list(saem_mod=saem_fit)`
`inits <- list(theta=c(.04, .7, 2))`
`cfg <- configsaem(model, theo_md, inits, seed = 50)`
` cfg$print <- 0`
` fit <- saem_fit(cfg) #export this fit to Unix for plotting`
`plot(fit) #plot in Unix`

Raising error (as before in #65):
`Error in .Primitive("".Call"")(<pointer: (nil)>, a, b, c) : `
  `NULL value passed as symbol address`
Unfortunately I was not able to find the clear root of this problem in the function code, but I suspect it is linked to the above problem with not checking operating system. 

In light of these issues, could you please take a look at getting these functions running on Unix, or at least raising an appropriate error.

I want to run nlmixr on each of the bootstrapped data sets, but it seems as if ID has been treated as a factor instead of a (character) vector.  The data I'm using (prior to bootstrapping) are just the theo_sd provided in nlmixr.  Some questions:

Q: How do I programmatically get just the data set used?  It seems to have name 'data.frame':
> str(trainfits[[1]])
nlmixr UI combined dataset and properties
'data.frame':	132 obs. of  22 variables:
 $ ID     : Factor w/ 7 levels ""1"",""3"",""4"",""6"",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ TIME   : num  0 0 0 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.57 0.57 0.57 1.12 ...
 ...

The tutorial at https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/nlmixr_bookdown/vignettes.html#rationale only says this:
""A table of fit data is also supplied. Please note:

    An nlmixr fit object is actually a data frame. Saving it as a Rdata object and then loading it without nlmixr will just show the data by itself. The additional fit information is still present, but nlmixr must be loaded in order to see it.""
	
It does not say how to actually get the data set used.
 
Q: It seems to be a mistake to have $ID as factors.  I'd like the data frame to show the actual data used with $ID as a column with mode character just like in the original data.  Sorting the $ID values as factors isn't helpful.

Q: The above problem is NOT the case for the example seen at  https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/nlmixr_bookdown/vignettes.html#rationale .  What's the difference?

Q: typo - change $omgea to $omega; search for all instances of $omgea first.  This is seen at https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/nlmixr_bookdown/vignettes.html#rationale for one example.

The Task bar Docker icon indicates the container type can be switched to Linux from but this failed because ""your Windows version is not compatible"". So I had to uninstall Docker, install it without asking for the Windows version, re-download a load of stuff and finally install nlmixr from a Linux container (big waste of time).

That would allow simplification of grouping on the row level.

Row spanning doesn't easily work with every output type (e.g. markdown), and for that, I could imagine a feature which would allow a function to define the behavior taking an input of the contents.  Some defaults off the top of my head could be `rowspan_blank(x)`, `rowspan_duplicate(x)`, `rowspan_text(x, value=""(continued)"")`.","billdenney",982,0

I followed the steps described [here](https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr). 
I installed [Anaconda 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (although when you select to download the 3.6 version, the 5.2 version is actually downloaded) . When I ran `RxODE::rxWinPythonSetup()` I had the following message:

`Requirement already satisfied: sympy in c:\users\abuhela\appdata\local\contin~1\anacon~1\lib\site-p~1 (1.1.1) distributed 1.21.8 requires msgpack, which is not installed.
You are using pip version 10.0.1, however version 18.0 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.`

I installed `mrgpack` by running the command ` pip install msgpack` and upgraded the pip by running the command `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`. 

I ran `RxODE::rxWinPythonSetup()`  in RStudio again which is supposed to install `SnakeCharmR` somehow? but it didn't. Here what I have got:

`RxODE::rxWinPythonSetup()`
`Attempting to install SymPy. This may take a few seconds...`
`Requirement already satisfied: sympy in c:\users\abuhela\appdata\local\contin~1\anacon~1\lib\site-p~1 (1.1.1)`
`Please restart your R session before using RxODE.`

I restarted but it didn't load the package.
`library(SnakeCharmR)`
`Error in library(SnakeCharmR) : there is no package called ‘SnakeCharmR’`

I had no issues installing `RxODE` but haven't got to the stage of installing `nlmixr` package itself. Need to sort this out first.

Any idea of what is going wrong here? Thanks!

"nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr","convention for nmDataConvert and infusion data if RATE > 0 and DV specified","https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/82","closed",2018-10-08,2018-10-13,2018-10-09,5,"I'm working with infusion data that I've previously fit with NONMEM. When using the `nmDataConvert`, I receive the following warning output ""Warning message: In nmDataConvert(test_data) :   Assumed all DV values are observations. (EVID=0)"". It is not clear how DV should be coded to get the correct EVID specification (I believe 10101). Coding DV as NA or ""."" (NM spec) does not affect the outcome.

short example below:

```R
library(nlmixr)

test_data = structure(list(ID = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), TIME = c(0, 0.041667, 0.0625, 0.16667, 0.29167, 
0.41667, 0.54167, 1, 2, 6, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84, 119, 142, 168
), DV = c(0, 74.15, 69.09, 49.96, 50.75, 50, 45.56, 42.08, 36.77, 
24.99, 23.01, 16.31, 12.4, 11.64, 6.04, 1.54, 0.53, 0.2, 0.2), 
    AMT = c(255, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
    0, 0, 0), RATE = c(6120, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
    0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)), row.names = c(NA, 19L), class = ""data.frame"")

input_data = nmDataConvert(test_data)
```
and output:
```R
Warning message:
In nmDataConvert(test_data) :
  Assumed all DV values are observations. (EVID=0)

> head(input_data, 2)

   ID       TIME DV   AMT  RATE EVID
1   1 0.00000000  0  6120  6120    0
21  1 0.04166667  0 -6120 -6120    0

```
I then just manually recode those EVIDs to 10101.

Relatedly, any additional documentation/tutorial/examples for infusion data would be greatly appreciated, especially EVID specification. I've been figuring out the rxode data requirements by reading various presentations with trial and error. nlmixr has been great and I'm trying to completely convert over. So far the data specs has been my main bottleneck.

Thanks so much!

My data covers a broad range of concentrations, so if I don't log-transform my DV values the fitted parameters are biased towards the higher concentrations, which I am coincidentally not as interested in.

My endpoint reads:
```R
cp = log(M)
cp ~ prop(prop.err)

 And I change my DVs to <- log(DV) (changing 0 values to 1e-100 beforehand). Theoretically I think this should be fine, but the model usually just returns the initial estimates without SEs reported.

My code is too long to reproduce here, but it looks kind of like this

```R
d(M.blood)/dt = - M.blood * ( kOutM + C.blood * kA) + MC.blood * kD;
d(C.blood)/dt = - C.blood * ( kOutC + M.blood * kA) + MC.blood * kD;

Cm = M.blood + MC.blood
Cb = MC.blood

Cm ~ prop(prop.err1) |  M.blood
Cb ~ prop(prop.err2) | MC.blood

The idea here is my data has dosing into the ""MC"" compartment, and sampling that does not distinguish between M and MC (measured M and MC only looks for M [a metal] present in both ""compartments""). This is essentially in vivo binding data. *

I have been able to run nlmixr without any errors on this model, but I just get the initial theta estimates (or very close) without SEs, so I think I am doing something wrong and would appreciate any advice.

\* For clarification: this is part of a broader PBPK model that has certain constraints which are more significant in fitting kA and kD (other transfer rates and free fractions are kept constant, etc)... certainly if the model were only the above, the data would always return ambiguous results.","rexjohnrx",9,0

how would one denote current time point in an equation using nlmixr? For example: what would be the equivalent of T in this fortran code using nlmixr in and ODE system? I tried 'time' but not taking it, perhaps because it needs to be declared separately? 

in fortran looks like: DEXP(-K*T)

I would to start using this package, but I ran into huge problems when installing it.
Is there a simple and reliable way to install this package?
I ask this because execution of the chain:
RTools -> Python -> SymPy -> RxODE -> devTools -> nlmixr -> xpose.nlmixr
— this is not an easy installation method, errors constantly appear on this way.

The installer for Windows, as I understand it, is already outdated, and versions of R , when it is installed, begin to conflict with each other, and incomprehensible errors constantly start to surface. Or is there a relatively new version of the installer with instruction for it? because after installation this ""installator"" nothing happened...

Previously, I had problems with working in some packages, in this case I can’t even start working because it cannot be simply installed. More truly, its separate parts cannot be installed. 

Thank you for help!

  RUNTIME ERROR:
Compilation error on line 7.
 Attempt to redefine node StandDose[1]

This is due to the following changes from Aug 2017:

""* ProbitLogNormal: Now also this model allows for a reference dose and a log transformation
  of the (standardized) dose. This can be specified with options refDose and useLogDose.

  * DualEndpoint: Same additional options as for ProbitLogNormal are now available for the
  DualEndpoint models. As a consequence, the parameter ""refDose"" for class 
  DualEndpointBeta needed to be renamed to ""refDoseBeta"", and the parameter ""refDose"" for
  class DualEndpointEmax renamed to ""refDoseEmax"".""

So somehow because I wanted the ""useLogDose"" parameter and I only wanted it to apply to the dose-tox model, but not the dose-efficacy model, I made this change.

I see as options:
1) I think the easiest fix would be to replace StandDose[j] by StandDoseEmax[j] in the whole JAGS model for DualEndpointEmax.
2) I think it is confusing to have another slot ""refDoseEmax"" in the DualEndpointEmax class, in the same way as it is confusing that the ""useLogDose"" parameter only applies to the dose tox model, but not the dose eff model. So another option would be to change this, such that the parameter also applies to the dose eff model. Then we would not need refDoseEmax anymore.

Both options would also apply to the other parametric models DualEndpointBeta etc.

Preferred solution is 2), useLogDose would also be applied to the PD-model and not only the Safety-model.

Here is the solution with which I could come up:

```
one.compartment.saem <- function() {

    d/dt(center) = ka * depot - cl / v * center
    cp = center / v 
    cp ~ add(add.err)
  })

`(?:d/dt\(|(?:\(0\)[[:space:]]*(?:=|~)))`
and if it finds any matches, then it throws the error (if im understanding the code).

It seems to imply that if the parameter assignments/declarations etc are with the ODE equations, then the error is thrown, but the parameters are listed first, followed by the ODE, followed by the concentration formulas, according to the nlmixr documentation. 
Im clearly formatting the model incorrectly but im not sure where or how.

I have a few suggestions about how this package should be laid out. Currently the packages info is added in one tibble, but this is a bit hard to future proof, and makes the code harder to read. Also the primary function of the risk metrics code is to generate an Rd file. I think the best way to generate package data is to store the code doing so in data-raw, following Hadley Wickham's advice [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/data.html) .

So I'd have something like

```
package_details <- list()

package_details$dplyr <- tibble::tibble(package = ""dplyr"", source = ""CRAN"", `21CFR` = ""N"")

package_details$emmeans <- tibble::tibble(package = ""dplyr"", source = ""CRAN"", `21CFR` = ""N"")

package_tibble <- purrr::reduce(package_details, dplyr::bind_rows)

usethis::use_data(package_tibble, overwrite = TRUE)
```
which makes an rdata file in /data . You can then make an R file called package_tibble which documents the data.

I'd then have a function called risk_metrics(packagedata = package_tibble) which takes the inputted tibble and gives up to date metrics. So I'd put stuff that is static and determined by us (package, location, 21cfr, other measures) in data_raw, then have functions to determine things like code coverage by making external calls.

For an intermediate point, we could simply hard code functions, so

```
code_cov(packagename)<- function{

if (packagename == ""dplyr"") return(83)
}
```

This then gives the user flexibility to add a new package to the package_tibble with details, and get information using the functions we've built.

If you like, I can make a fork implementing something like this.","kieranjmartin",545,0

I had changed the CMT and EVID in my data to account for the proper dosing and response compartments, numbering them according to the ODEs as they were listed in the model (a total of 234 ODEs)

The two response values were listed as such in the model, as per the previous issue:

```

As you can see, we are using a 27 day initialization to initialize the model. Thinking that that may have something to do with the error, i also tried doing it without the initial non-dose time points:

# Prioritization of Metrics
1. Metrics which can be assessed **without source code**
2. Metrics which **require installation of package**
3. Metrics which can be derived with **source code of package alone**
4. Metrics which rely on **source code of package and installation of all dependencies**


---

# Coverage Considerations
Code coverage for validated software becomes a bit more involved than ensuring a single package in isolation runs properly. Looking longterm, we may want to consider a metric that considers the code of dependent code. 

For a hyperbolic example, consider a package which has a single function that re-exports a sophisticated statistical model function. Testing this package to 100% coverage would be trivial, though the underlying code is far more involved. We could then consider all the imported statistical model code as part of the parent package and its code coverage would then be dependent on the code coverage of the imported code. 

To calculate this is non-trivial. We could follow a process like this:
1. Calculate per-expression code coverage with `covr::tally_coverage(by=""expression"")`
2. Parse expressions for dependency imports
3. Derive per-expression coverage
   a. For expressions with no dependencies, coverage from `covr` can be used
   b. For expressions with dependency, store reference to dependency
4. Build directed graph of package dependencies
5. Walk graph and fill in expression coverage
6. Tally expression coverage for each package export

Since we might, at a later stage, also include metrics computed from packages directly, I would suggest distinguishing between a 'scrape' (online info) and 'get' (directly from package sources) function.

    scrape_test_coverage <- function(pkgname, version, ...)
    get_test_coverage <- function(path_to_targz, ...)

Alternatively, (not sure whether it is worth it atm) we could make this more generic by making `get/scrape` S3 generics and implement them as methods so that calls like 

    get(Test_Coverage(),  path_to_targz, ...)
    scrape(Test_Coverage(), version, ...)

become possible. The latter might be a bit cleaner and makes for shorter function/method names (+ metrics can be parametrized at instantiation -> less clutter in function call!) but it is certainly not necessary.

It currently contains minimal data, but could be used to dispatch to other functions for aggregating package metadata needed to provide a risk score.

The plan here is to create a single function that can be called with a variety of ways of specifying a package and provide back an S3 class object that can be dispatched to handle that package source appropriately.

Given `as.pkg_ref(x)` where

|working directory|`x = `| returns output of `class`|
|---|---|---|
|-|`""dplyr""`|`c(""pkg_install"", ""pkg_ref"")`(if dplyr installed)|
|riskmetric directory|`""../riskmetric""`|`c(""pkg_source"", ""pkg_ref"")`|
|-|`""blah.blah.blah""`|`c(""pkg_missing"", ""pkg_ref"")`|
|-|`""dplyr""`|`c(""pkg_remote"", ""pkg_ref"")` (if dplyr not installed)|

I think that this approach could help us streamline how we unify methods where possible, and how we handle separate sources elegantly.

### Examples of situations where S3 is beneficial
- If there are some metrics which require source code, we can create functions `as.pkg_source.pkg_install` and `as.pkg_source.pkg_remote` to pull the `URL` field from the description to download the source and return a `pkg_source` reference to the local clone. 
- If we want to assess unit test coverage differently for a remote reference on CRAN and source code cloned locally, we could have two separate functions `get_pkg_coverage.pkg_remote` which might try to pull the coverage out of a badge or CI tool and `get_pkg_coverage.pkg_source` which might run all the tests itself.

### Some areas for further improvement:
- perhaps a global variable such as `options(pkg_refs = c(""remote""))` could be used to only consider package references from certain source types, allowing for the metric calculations to run quickly by only scraping data from the web or  alternatively use `options(pkg_refs = c(""source"", ""install"", ""remotes""))` to always use the most rigorous method available.

Let me know if this sounds like a viable path to take, or if there are glaring gaps in this concept of a package design. ","dgkf",21,-3

After installing nlmixr, I ran nlmixrValidate(full = TRUE). The validation terminated early due to too many failures. There were many mismatches at the estimated AIC/BIC/other values, and some of them are shown below.
When I ran the PK examples from https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlmixr/vignettes/running_nlmixr.html , I did get the same parameter estimates and OFJV for both the nlme and saem methods. (The sessionInfo is shown below)
So the question is: should we be worried about the failures identified in nlmixrValidate?
Many thanks for your help!

I thought of investigating this by re-running the fit with several different initial values, to see how stable the result is, i.e. whether the estimated effects are the same more or less independently of the initial value.

**Question 1**: Is it the sound approach to diagnose such (potential) convergence issues? It seems a bit rudimentary approach... (I can imagine that someone who has a knowledge on how `nlmixr`s estimation works can provide a much more sophisticated way to diagnose convergence.)

**Question 2**: If so, how to realize this investigation? This is the best with which I could come up, but it is very-very-very non-elegant (I think):

---

Thinking about downstream use of a `pkg_reference` object bit more critically, I also think we'll have to find a way to not repeatedly make costly queries for every `get_*`-style functions. For example, if we have `get_public_contributions`, `get_has_public_repo`, `get_bugreports_response_history` (just for sake of example), all of these might hit similar parts of the GitHub / GitLab apis. 

Instead of making repeated queries to an api or repeatedly reading in things like the `Meta/Rd.rds` file, how should we cache the results once for repeated use? Some options may include

1. Use `memoise` to cache these passively behind a in-package function call
2. Store reusable metadata within the `pkg_reference` and preferentially use metadata from within this structure any time a new query is being posed.
3. Use top-level `get_*` functions (e.g. `get_GitHub`) to query all relevant sub-queries and return a list of metadata objects for evaluation.","dgkf",1,0

---

Similar to using S3 for the `get_*` function dispatch, I think that the scoring function should also be extensible to allow organizations to customize the way that package metadata is summarized, and that each `get_*` (or alternatively named) function should return a standardized S3 object which can be extended for scoring overloading.

A trivial example may be to have `get_has_NEWS()` which may return an S3 object such as 

```r
structure(TRUE, class = c(""has_NEWS_metadata"", ""pkg_metadata"")
```

which is then passed to `score.has_NEWS_metadata()`

A more meaningful example might be for `get_public_contributions(x)` which might return:

```r
structure(data.frame(
  name = c(""dgkf"", ""kkmann"", ""elong0527""), 
  line_edits = c(23, 42, 777),
  last_edit = c(""2019-01-02"", ""2019-02-03"", ""2019-03-04"")), 
  class = c(""public_contributions_metadata"", ""pkg_metadata""))
```

where `score.public_contributions_metadata(x)` evaluates to just `nrow(x) > 1`, but a more sophisticated way to evaluate risk might be to look at the distribution of lines contributed by contributors as a proxy for distributed familiarity of the package code base.","dgkf",68,0

I am using nlmixr and try to calculate a volume V. I want to have an IF statement that uses a condition on V to change the equation. For example:

```
if (V>=1.5) {
d/dt(V) = k*V-d
 } else {
d/dt(V) = k*V
}
```

When I do that I get the following error:

A very new user here... I would like to use an ode model to fit my data using nlmixr saem. 

- With `nlmixr(vivo, dat, est=""saem"")`, R crashes after 149th iteration 

-  With `fit <- nlmixr(vivo, dat, est=""saem"", saemControl(n.burn=90, n.em=50))`, I receive the following messages, but nlmixr moves on with calculating residuals/tables:

It seems that there are three issues here. First of all, the fit function is unable to fit the model but maybe it's an inappropriate model for the data with bad initial values. I don't know. 

Next, notice the initial value of the objective function. It is different in the three invocations although the data and parameters are unchanged.

Finally, isn't there something weird about the printed parameter values of the random effect variances? In the model, they are set to `0.1` but in the first `U` line of the optimization trace, the values are `1.778`. I tried to vary the initial values and it seems that the value printed is `v^(-1/4)` where `v` is the value to the right of `~`. Is that expected? I see that the other parameters match their initial values in the `U` line.","andreasnoack",2,-4

Let's take the most basic example from the vignette:

```
library(nlmixr)

one.compartment.saem <- function() {
    ini({
        tka <- .5   # Log Ka
        tcl <- -3.2 # Log Cl
        tv <- -1    # Log V
        eta.ka ~ 1
        eta.cl ~ 2
        eta.v ~ 1
        add.err <- 0.1
    })
    model({
        ka <- exp(tka + eta.ka)
        cl <- exp(tcl + eta.cl)
        v <- exp(tv + eta.v)
        d/dt(depot) = -ka * depot
        d/dt(center) = ka * depot - cl / v * center
        cp = center / v 
        cp ~ add(add.err)
    })
}
```

Now, let's run the model, and then *re-run it with the only change being* that the starting values of the parameters are set to the estimated results of the first run:

```
fit <- nlmixr(one.compartment.saem, theo_sd, est=""saem"")
fit$theta
fit2<-nlmixr(update(fit,tka=fit$theta[""tka""],tcl=fit$theta[""tcl""],
    tv=fit$theta[""tv""]),theo_sd,""saem"")
fit2$theta
```

So what we see is that there are differences above an order of magnitude (!) just by this simple change in the initial value!

This would of course mean that the results are practically useless, which is hard to believe (as this is a horribly simple model! if there are convergence problems here, then there are everywhere), so I think I'm making a mistake somewhere, but I don't where...","tamas-ferenci",2,0

R is installed on this drive as well as my R libraries, and this is where I want nlmixr to be.  (It's my F:/ drive.)  Unfortunately I'm now having trouble getting nlmixr to work properly.  The output is below and is fairly self-explanatory with the comments.  The problem arises in compiling the model.  I believe there is a conflict somehow with my RTools installations but I'm not sure what is the problem.  Note that after I tried to install the latest from Github, when it didn't work I tried the latest released (in the installer for Windows) and that still isn't working.

I'd sure appreciate some help getting this to work for me as it used to on my old laptop that stopped working.

Thanks,

James

The core functionality that we're trying to hit are:

- [x] At least 2 metrics robustly developed 
- [x] A master ""assessment"" function that can be run to evaluate available metrics given a list of packages to assess
- [x] Perhaps a vignette on how to develop a new metric and score metrics within an organization
- [ ] Create a project board as a backlog of metrics to be implemented such that new contributors will have a good idea of what they can do to add to the package.

The idea is that we have enough built for a small demo -- ideally 2+ metrics that can be assessed over a list of packages. With a working demo, we can use R/Pharma as an opportunity to show others in the industry how they can contribute new metric functions to a central code base and implement summarizing functions on top of the metrics to characterize risk.

@andyofsmeg - let me know if this is in line with what you were expecting.

There are a couple small utilities added for getting a list of non-installed CRAN package names and installed package names to make it easier to share examples (as shown below)

Some examples of how this might be used:

1. using a remote package:
   ```r
   pkg_name <- sample(riskmetric:::not_installed_packages(), 1)
   pkg <- as.pkg_ref(pkg_name)  
   assessment <- assess_has_news(pkg)
   assessment_risk_score <- score(assessment)
   
   cat(sprintf(
     ""package '%s' has %s NEWS file"", 
     pkg_name, 
     if (assessment_risk_score) ""a"" else ""no""))
   ```

2. using an installed package:
   ```r
   pkg_name <- sample(riskmetric:::installed_packages(), 1)
   pkg <- as.pkg_ref(pkg_name)  
   assessment <- assess_has_news(pkg)
   assessment_risk_score <- score(assessment)
   
   cat(sprintf(
     ""package '%s' has %s NEWS file"", 
     pkg_name, 
     if (assessment_risk_score) ""a"" else ""no""))
   ```

3. using a package source directory:
   ```r
   pkg_dir <- getwd()  # assuming working directory is riskmetric package directory
   pkg <- as.pkg_ref(pkg_dir)  
   assessment <- assess_has_news(pkg)
   assessment_risk_score <- score(assessment)
   
   cat(sprintf(
     ""package source at '%s' has %s NEWS file"", 
     pkg_dir, 
     if (assessment_risk_score) ""a"" else ""no""))
   ```

"pharmaR/riskmetric","function naming conventions & package structure (part 2)","https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric/issues/27","closed",2019-07-09,2019-08-03,2019-08-03,1,"A continuation of the issue thread #16 now that we've started to settle on a more concrete structure for the package.

In response to @kkmann's suggestions in that thread, I think that having some sort of prefix for the `get_*`-style functions is necessary to keep them easily discoverable. Since all of these functions are inherently similar in their accepted input datatypes and output datatypes, I think that this prefix is valuable for communicating this consistency (similar to `testthat::expect_*` or `ggplot2::geom_*`). 

## naming convention proposal

I've been toying around with the following naming convention and flow for how a summarized score might eventually be developed. It uses three templates for functions, `assess_*` (replacing `get_*`), `score` and `summarize_risk`:

- `assess_*` (e.g. `assess_coverage`, `assess_has_news`)
   This is used for initially gathering related metadata pertaining to an individual metric. This family of functions would be used to transform a package reference into a package metric.
   
   |input|function|output|
   |---|---|--|
   |**S3** `c(""pkg_install"", ""pkg_reference"")`|`assess_coverage.pkg_install`|**S3** `c(""pkg_metric_coverage"", ""pkg_metric"")`|

- `score` (e.g. `score.pkg_coverage`, `score.pkg_has_news`)
   Ideally this is just a single function that dispatches based on the type of metric that is to be scored such that we can define a conversion from metric metadata to some numeric indication of quality (I propose a 0-1 scale for all scores). For example, for `pkg_has_news`, any presence of a valid NEWS file might be considered a 1 on a 0 to 1 scale. We can then iterate on this if we want more granularity.

   |input|function|output|
   |---|---|---|
   |**S3** `c(""pkg_metric_coverage"", ""pkg_metric"")`|`score.pkg_metric_coverage`|**numeric** (0-1)|

- `summarize_risk`
   Finally, with one score per metric we can define a summarizing function to characterize the risk of a package with a single value.

   |input|function|output|
   |---|---|---|
   |**numeric vector** (0-1)|`summarize_risk`|**numeric** (0-1)|

## example package workflow using this structure

With all of these pieces in play, a common usage might look like this:

1. create a tibble column of package names

   |package|
   |---|
   |`""tools""`|
   |`""ggplot2""`|
   |...|
1. apply `as.pkg_reference` over column to create a column of `pkg_reference` objects

   |package|
   |---|
   |`<S3: pkg_install, pkg_reference>`|
   |`<S3: pkg_remote, pkg_reference>`|
   |...|
1. apply a list of `assess_*` functions to each `pkg_reference` object to produce a tibble of `pkg_metric` columns (one per assessment)

   |package|coverage|has_news|
   |---|---|---|
   |`<S3: pkg_install, pkg_reference>`|`<S3: pkg_metric_coverage, pkg_metric>`|`<S3: pkg_metric_has_news, pkg_metric>`|
   |`<S3: pkg_remote, pkg_reference>`|`<S3: pkg_metric_coverage, pkg_metric>`|`<S3: pkg_metric_has_news, pkg_metric>`|
   |...|...|...|
1. apply `score` to all cells except in column ""package"", producing a tibble of numeric scores (one per assessment)

   |package|coverage|has_news|
   |---|---|---|
   |`<S3: pkg_install, pkg_reference>`|0.95|1|
   |`<S3: pkg_remote, pkg_reference>`|0.87|1|
   |...|...|...|
1. summarize all scores into a summarized risk score 

   |package|coverage|has_news|risk score|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |`<S3: pkg_install, pkg_reference>`|0.95|1|**0.02**|
   |`<S3: pkg_remote, pkg_reference>`|0.87|1|**0.07**|
   |...|...|...|...|

I think it would be nice to have a user-facing function that accepts a list of package names (or `pkg_reference` objects) and an optional list of `assess_*` functions (defaulting to using all available internal `assess_*` functions) to do this in a user-friendly way. ","dgkf",25,0

I would like to code a model with a Tlag in nlmixr but I have some issues.

First to be more precise, it is a one-compartment model, with first-order absorption kinetics and linear elimination kinetics. 
The drug is administered orally. 

I coded my model as follows: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52911686/61216951-ea12eb80-a70e-11e9-8b03-2a2eefb9f975.png)

However, when I launch my fit thanks to the following instructions:
fit <- nlmixr(f, data, est=""saem"", saemControl(seed=123456, n.burn=5, n.em=300, nmc=5), table = tableControl(cwres=TRUE, npde=TRUE))

I receive the error message below:

Is the synthesis of the model with a Tlag correct? Indeed, I did not find any model with a Tlag, so I was inspired by the guidelines with a model without Tlag (so a ka, v, cl model) and I do not know if the code I wrote is correct.
I know that a closed form solution exists because I estimate the population parameter with this model with a Tlag with other software. 

I also tried to code the model in ODE form. I ended up with the following code:

The fit was done correctly. I still wonder if the syntax is correct or should I code the model differently?

The solution is perfect, but we of course know that every other solution is totally equally perfect where `a+b=0.4`. I have no PK knowledge, but in regression modeling we usually say that these parameters are not identifiable (separately), hope this terminology is meaningful here as well.

So my question is, and I know that I might be asking for too much / off-topic here, but is there any way to automatically detect such identifiability problems? Currently `nlmixr` returns an essentially random solution out of the infinite number of potential solutions, which is fine, my problem is that we have no warning about it...","tamas-ferenci",3,0

I was working with nlmxir (ver. 1.0.0-7) and had to update one of the package (RxODE), which unfortunately caused the program to cease working. I uninstalled all program (including R itself) and reinstall nlmixr using the Windows installer (ver. 1.1.0-9), and re-run the identical code with identical data. The results baffled me as the Objective Function Value and Visual Predictive Check were significantly different from the previous version. 

Below is the code that I used for a 1-compartment model, which was identical between both runs.  
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=F, cache=T, results=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

The OFV given was -1621.541


However, with ver. 1.1.0-9, the vpc looked like this

The S3-style package reference objects evolved out of a fairly minimalist design which slowly grew in complexity when we tried to put on some guardrails to prevent re-deriving intensive metadata or derived values. 

In practice, it's beginning to resemble an R6 class. Would it be better to rewrite these pieces in R6? Would an R6 design be more contributor-friendly since it's familiar, or more challenging because it would require more familiarity with the class construction?

Admittedly I don't have all that much experience with R6, so I don't have a strong sense for the pros and cons.","dgkf",384,0

I was interested to see what's going on under the hood when one calls `AIC(fit)` with a usual model estimated with SAEM. What I found was that `AIC.default` is called from package `stats` which will call `logLik(fit)`. Now, `logLik(fit)` will actually call `logLik.nlmixrFitData` from the package `nlmixr` (the fitted object has another class, to which a `logLik` method pertains, the `nlmixrFitCore` but it is listed *after* `nlmixrFitData` in `class(fit)`). This function will call `fit$logLik` and this is the point where I'm stuck.

First of all, I was under the impression that `$` can be used as an extractor, but `str(fit)` doesn't show that `fit` has any component named `logLik`, more importantly it is quite clear that `fit$logLik` not only extracts something stored, but performs an operation, it seems it calls a function. Is it possible to achieve that extracting a component induces a function call...?? If so, how to find the code? (I can't use `methods`, `getAnywhere` etc. for this situation.)","tamas-ferenci",1,0

My observation is that it will sooner or later, but inevitably crash (without any further message: I either just receive the standard ""R session abnormally terminated due to an unexpected crash"" window or I don't receive anything at all, just the whole procedure halts).

I called it ""semi-reproducible"" because when it'll exactly crash changes from running to running (I used `set.seed`, so perhaps due to the stochasticity in the fitting algorithm itself? I don't know...), but my experience is that is always crashes within <20 loops.

Here is my `devtools::session_info()`:

"nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr","Can't successfully install nlmixr on mac","https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/225","closed",2019-08-19,2019-09-10,2019-09-10,18,"Hello

I have tried reinstalling nlmixr on my device, since initially the installed version was failing to generate vpc plots.
I have recently tried reinstalling with a more updated version of R (version 3.6.0), and managed to get in the installation to the stage of running “library(RxODE); rxTest();” without any major issues:
#### results test rx ####

Results ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Duration: 3980.9 s
OK:       5202
Failed:   1
Warnings: 3
Skipped:  3

However, proceeding to install nlmixr, it couldn’t move forward because of a warning message “nlmixr not available for R version 3.6.0. Thus, I reinstalled everything step by step as instructed on your github page (with R 3.5.2), but now there seems to be some compilation issues, whenever trying to install the nlmixr package.
For some of my attempts, I was ending up with this error:

> ode_cmt1.cpp:7:10: fatal error: 'stan/math/rev/core.hpp' file not found
> #include <stan/math/rev/core.hpp>



 Also, I am not quite sure how to allow for python3 to be used by nlmixr. During the time it worked (without vpc), it used python 2.7. I did modify the R.profile file in order for it to recognize the newer version but to no avail.


I have also tried installing Rcpp (and all related files e.g. RccpEigen) separately within R via install.packages() command. Additionally, I’ve installed Eigen through brew (all of these steps were following a series of tries on a normal process of installation, all rendering exactly the same result). I even reinstalled brew and will attempt reinstalling XCode if nothing else helps.

If I could facilitate by providing some additional info, I'll gladly do it.

If anyone has been using nlmixr with R 3.6.0 on Mac without any issues and could instruct me on how to remove any files that could have altered compilation, I would be extremely grateful!

At least with these two data sets and using the codes in the nlmixr github tutorials running nlmixr causes one column to display nan's, and the model will not fit at all with multiple warning messages. This error does not occur when using additive error.

```R

    lVc <- log(90)   # log Vc (L)

    prop.err <- c(0, 0.2, 1)
    
    eta.Cl ~ 0.1     # BSV Cl
    eta.Vc ~ 0.1     # BSV Vc

I'd appreciate your help with the install, it appears that I am stuck and I have spent a full day already on this. Here's my session info: I am running 64-bit Windows, R Version [64-bit] C:\Program Files\R\R-3.5.0. My question is whether it's possible to not have SnakeCharmR installed and still have successful installation?
Running [source(""test_install.R"")], I get:

As you can see, SnakeCharmR is not installed and library(SnakeCharmR) returns Error in library(SnakeCharmR) : there is no package called ‘SnakeCharmR’.
devtools::install_github(""nlmixrdevelopment/SnakeCharmR"") gives an error:

Note that I am using Anaconda and nlmixr appears to be seeing this:

I am new to nlmixr and I am not sure about the appropriate way to fit a dichotomous covariate into a model. 

I have two covariates which I would like to include in the model: (1) Weight (WT) which I coded in a way similar to issue #55, and (2) A dichotomous covariate, ""fasting"" versus ""fed"" status (appear as a column ""FOOD"" in the dataset). 

The structural model is a 1-compartment, transit absorption model. I used ""f"" to estimate the relative bioavailability between the two feeding status, but at the same time, I also want to find out if the covariate ""FOOD"" will affect absorption parameter (at the moment, only ""n""), and use ""ncov"" to estimate the effect. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, results=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=F, echo=T}

Is there any specific way to do mu-referencing in nlmixr? Or is there any specific way to fit dichotomous covariate into the model? Any help will be much appreciated, thank you.  ","WenYao-Mak",5,0

"pharmaR/riskmetric","Dependency Code Coverage","https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric/issues/41","open",2019-09-23,2019-09-23,NA,0,"Code coverage of a package in isolation is meant to test stability of the package's addition to its dependencies and isn't a reflection of the entire software stack's coverage.

As a developer of a package, test coverage indicates how stably you're adding to your dependencies and how reliable your own additions are. However, for software validation you are also concerned with issues that may percolate up through your dependencies -- you may be more interested in how the entire software stack is covered.

To effectively assess code coverage for validated software, you would likely want some way of aggregating the coverage of a package, taking into account the coverage of its dependencies. This could take a number of forms

### Simplest Solution

Take the minimum coverage of a package and its dependencies. This has known issues of potentially depending on only a single function with no coverage (possibly overrepresenting code coverage of dependencies) and treating all dependencies as equal. 

### Rigorous Solution

Ideally, you would need to account for the coverage of only the functions/objects on which a line of code in the parent package depends. To do this, we would likely need to track coverage per exported value for each package and consider the footprint of that function (number of lines or expressions) so that the code coverage of the parent package expression can be re-weighted.

This comes with a number of really challenging technical problems.
1. Code coverage would have to be calculated for all dependencies
1. A per-export code coverage graph would have to be produced including code coverage (by line or expression) and the number of lines or expressions needed to build the exported value
1. The graph isn't necessarily acyclic, as recursive patterns would need to be pruned
1. Doing this for many related packages would cause a lot of duplicate calculation so it may require some mechanism of caching coverage results.
1. Calculating a ""weighted"" coverage for an expression in a parent package would require some static code analysis to determine which expressions incorporate dependent code.

Depending on how rigorous we want to be, this might be mostly covered by `R CMD check`, which gives a warning about undocumented parameters. 

Some possible considerations:

- Look for some keywords that indicate datatypes or defaults in the parameter description or  return value (like `character`, `logical`, `numeric`, `factor`, `formula`, `vector`, `matrix`, `list` `data.frame`, `atomic`, `object`, `class`) It wouldn't be foolproof, but on average it might give an indication of what a ""good"" parameter documentation might look like. I'm sure someone could have some fun with language processing to try to do this more intelligently, but I think something simple might be a little easier to reason about initially.

- Trying to give each parameter/return a score based on number of characters in the description (not trying to be too overbearing, but perhaps the score per parameter scales linearly with characters up to some fairly minimal cutoff like 20 characters to try to not inflate packages with really terse, unhelpful documentation).

Clearly this won't be entirely rigorous as package downloads don't inherently map to package users, but surely it provides a relative measure of adoption. 

We could consider implementing multiple ""views"" of the same metric, for example 
- \# of packages in the past year
- \# of packages in the past few months
- month over month download growth: rate of change of downloads/day over last few month?

I'm sure we can get really creative about this.

One design consideration that arises is how to handle the different sources of BugReports urls and remote package page urls.

"nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr","Feature Request:  Improved VPC Simulation Datasets","https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/247","open",2019-10-29,2020-03-06,NA,7,"One of the features that I always want to overcome with VPCs is the discretized nature of the independent variable axis.  It has historically been limited by the fact that simulations are performed on the basis of the original dataset rather than an augmented dataset.  I have always interpreted the reason for this as simplicity:  Running a VPC on the original dataset is easier than generating a new one, running the simulation on that, and then summarizing.

With that preamble...

Summary: At least for the single-endpoint model, I think that an expanded VPC dataset would improve the visualizations and precision of VPCs.  For multi-endpoint models, that may become difficult or (near) impossible to include all endpoints.

I would love it if `nlmixr` would have an option to expand the dataset so that all individuals have all independent variable values.  (For example, with actual time post dose, some subjects will have samples at 0.99, 1, and 1.01 hours-- so, ensure that all subjects have all three of those time points.)

There are some complexities that immediately come to mind:
* How do you handle covariate values?
    * I can imagine two simple options there as interpolate between the original points (with first observation carried backward [FOCB] and last observation carried forward [LOCF]) or a simple FOCB and LOCF without interpolation.
* How do you handle the fact that some subjects may not be appropriate to have a given independent variable measurement?
    * That is more complex, and I think that it would involve specifying the stratification and doing the independent variable expansion only within a stratification level.
* What if there are multiple endpoints with either different independent variables, different strata, or different covariates of interest?
    * For different independent variables (e.g. time for PK and concentration for PD), I think that either separate VPCs should be run by endpoint or it may just be approximately impossible.  (It could be impossible in the case where concentration is the predictor, but with a simultaneous PK/PD model, you can't make concentration independent.  In the impossible situation, again a fallback to the current standard may have to suffice.)
        * Alternate options which would be difficult to automate would be to have a multi-stage VPC where the PK model simulated first, then the PD model was simulated from the concentration data in the PK model with full expansion of the dataset.  I would not advocate for this as part of the first solution.
    * For different strata, I think that each endpoint should optionally be separated expanded by all strata.  This one may be a problem to automatically fix, but I would guess that it would be a relatively uncommon problem for which the user could fall back to the current method.
    * For different covariates of interest, I think that would be handled by just having all covariates extrapolated throughout the dataset (regardless of the endpoint).","billdenney",603,474

"pharmaR/riskmetric","Should the Bioconductor Support Site be considered a default BugReport url?","https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric/issues/62","open",2019-11-04,2019-11-04,NA,0,"Related to #56 

I'm looking at how to accommodate a BugReports assessment for Bioconductor packages. I didn't realize that the preferred support mechanism was through the Bioconductor support site and that only a small fraction of packages use BugReports.

>**From Bioconductor's [Package Submission Guide](https://www.bioconductor.org/developers/package-submission/)**
>
>The support site is the official support channel for users. Users and even developers may ask questions regarding your package on this platform. Be sure to include all the packages that you maintain in the “Watched Tags” section of your support site profile. This will notify you of any questions posted regarding your package(s). It is important to promptly respond to bug reports and questions either on the Bioconductor support site post or directly to developers. Some maintainers prefer to indicate a BugReports: field in their package’s DESCRIPTION file. This field indicates a particular web page for submitting bug reports and questions.

Trying to accommodate the support site seems like quite a daunting task. If anything, I think we might want to treat this as a separate form of support, perhaps more akin to StackOverflow or the RStudio Discourse. 

I'm planning to proceed with only considering the url in the BugReports field. Please let me know if there are any concerns with the approach. ","dgkf",597,597
"nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr","move #include <stan/math/prim/mat/fun/Eigen.hpp>","https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/pull/250","closed",2019-11-10,2019-11-11,2019-11-10,5,"The nlmixr R package will fail with the next version of StanHeaders due to a useful but somewhat incompatible change introduced in Stan Math 2.20 that uses the Eigen plugin mechanism to hold adjoints along with the double values in `Eigen::Matrix<T, -1, -1>`. According to the Eigen [documentation](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicCustomizing_Plugins.html) such plugins have to be `#include`d before any other Eigen headers. The nlmixr R package `#includes` it after `#include <RcppEigen.h>` which in turn `#includes` all the other Eigen headers, leading to compilation errors.

The fix in this is PR is trivial and passes R CMD check both with the CRAN and soon-to-be CRAN StanHeaders. If you need to test with the soon-to-be CRAN StanHeaders, you can do
```
source(""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stan-dev/rstan/for_2.20/StanHeaders/install-github.R"")
install_StanHeaders(math_branch = ""StanHeaders_2.21"",
                    library_branch = ""StanHeaders_2.21"")
```
There is also an unrelated NOTE when doing R CMD check on due to man/foceiControl.Rd referring to http://apmonitor.com/me575/uploads/Main/optimization_book.pdf which seems to be a dead URL.

Please upload another version of nlmixr to CRAN ASAP so that I can upload StanHeaders early this week and have it pass the reverse dependency checks automatically. Also, @wds15 is facing a hard deadline Friday to get updated versions of official Stan-related things onto the server at Novartis.

AFTER the soon-to-be CRAN is released, you may want to put `RcppParallel` in the `LinkingTo` and making the corresponding changes to your Makevars file (basically adding `-DSTAN_THREADS` to the compiler flags and `RcppParallel::LdFlags()` to the linker flags). However, the TBB library packaged by RcppParallel and used by Stan Math 3.0 when `STAN_THREADS` is defined is Apache licensed, which is deemed to be incompatible with GPL-2 by the FSF. The FSF considers the Apache license to be compatible with GPL-3, so making nlmixr GPL-3 or GPL-3+ would allow it to take advantage of these speed ups.

And yes, that makes initial familiarization with the package somewhat more burdensome than it might otherwise be, but the extensibility will be critical to future success and adoption of the package, so it is very clearly worthwhile.

So as @dgkf already knows, rOpenSci are embarking upon a new endeavour to develop a system to peer-review explicitly *statistical* software packages. Among many other necessities will be the development of tools to assess the ""quality"" of software (whatever that might be deemed to be). Neither we nor you want to expend effort repeating prior development efforts of other people, and so ... i'm pretty confident at this very early stage that i can say that we will build at least part of the system directly on `riskmetric`. To that end, I have devoted quite some time familiarizing myself with the package, and so offer, in the tradition of rOpenSci reviews, the following observations. Please note that I have done nothing but engage in the *easy* job of armchair criticism here. Accordingly, please do not interpret any of the following as implying any degree of overt criticism of the package as a whole, which really is very impressive. The observations are merely made in the hope that addressing them may serve to improve the package even more.

I'll focus here only on the meta-level of package functionality as presented in the vignettes, and so divide this in to the corresponding sections.

## Main vignette

- The main vignette jobs a pretty good job of explaining the principles on which the package is built. These principles, and particularly the general `pkg_ref` -> `assess` -> `score` workflow is utterly necessary to understanding how the package works, so I'd suggest it is critical to at least briefly explain these steps, and their individual and collective importance, in the README, rather than the current state of explaining them only in the vignette. Most users will want and expect to be able to at least get started through just scanning the README, yet this is not currently possible. At the very least, you could have a disclaimer in the README clarifying that it is necessary to read the main vignette in order to know how to use the package.

- No criticism here, but these three core steps really are (in my opinion at least) a brilliant way of accommodating flexibility at all crucial stages of specifying both *what* and *how* metrics are to be assessed and scored. This truly is a lovely implementation - painless, intuitive, and extensible.

- The ""core verbs"" section serves no real purpose as is, because it does not explain what they are, and so leaves a reader doing little other than wondering what they are supposed to do with that section. I'm not sure whether you mean to imply that the core verbs are: `""assess""`, `""score""`, and `""summarise""`, or something else? The link to the Extending vignette does no help to clarify at that juncture.

- Under `""assess""`, I'd suggest breaking the first bit prior to, ""For example ... NEWS files ..."", and clarify that available assessments can be seen with the `all_assessments` function, and then have a dump of the output of that in the vignette itself. The text of the ""Adding and Assessment"" bit of the Extending vignette could very well live in the first vignette, where it would greatly help to understand the importance of Assessments at the outset.

- It might help to explain in this first vignette the two primary classes of objects produced by the package: `pkg_ref` and `pkg_metric` objects, and explain how these are related to the `pkg_ref` -> `assess` -> `score` workflow. It would also seem to me to be necessary to explicitly describe the relationship between the output of `assess` and a `pkg_metric` object, because this is currently not explained anywhere, yet understanding that relationship would be of great help in understanding the overall package.

- In fact, it would probably help a lot to initially focus on a `pkg_ref` -> `pkg_metric` workflow (which works perfectly, even though one would not suspect that from `?pkg_metric`, which is currently not particularly helpful). Once i understand that, then understanding `pkg_ref` -> `assess` becomes much easier, because `assess` just yields a meta-collection of `pkg_metric` objects. (The `pkg_metric()` *function* is in fact really useful at prying in under the hood here, so i really would suggest bringing that more to the (documentation) fore. Current description:
  > A helper for structuring assessment return objects for dispatch with the score function

  ... is not really accurate at all. It actually generates a `pkg_metric` object as part of the `assess` function.)


## Extending riskmetric

- I think it would be useful at the outset of this vignette to explain the four classes of `pkg_ref` object (`""pkg_remote"", ""pkg_install"", ""pkg_source"", ""pkg_missing""`) (or maybe just the first 3, i guess?). Then just explain that the Assessment methods are dispatched for each class of `pkg_ref` object. As is, you say that,
  > We’ll focus on just the generic and the pkg_install functions

  but i've no idea at that point what ""the pkg_install functions"" means, so - in the context of the text as currently written - you've lost me from that point on.

- You say that from the `""assess""` function, 
  > a pkg_metric object is returned, which stores arbitrary data pertaining to the metric and importantly adopts a unique subclass for the assessment function.

  but this function actually just returns a tibble with no special class attributes, right? Some but not all of the items of that tibble are `pkg_metric` objects (... and see the above comments about `pkg_ref` and `pkg_metric` objects...)

- The need to jump straight into caching is a bit confusing. It would seem necessary to explicitly explain the the entire package *only* works via a caching system. You currently have
  > Now, for our new metric, we want to cache the package name’s first letter.

  but i am also free to read it at that point and think, ""No, i don't want to cache it; i just want to try to write a first assessment function without this pesky caching, and can always add that later, right?"" - Nope, not right, because caching is essential and integral to package functioning. This should be explained simply and mechanistically at this point, along the lines of ""all assessment functions work by caching .."" and describe simply but precisely how calls to `pkg_ref` rely on `pkg_ref_cache`. (The section itself is called ""Example Metadata Caching"", which is further unhelpful in that context but connoting that it really is not necessary, yet it is actually absolutely essential here.)


## General comments

I'll just offer one initially, regarding function names, the main ones of which are arguably somewhat overly generic: `assess`, `score`, and `coverage` will almost certainly meet namespace conflicts at some stage (and yes, `coverage` directly calls the `covr` function of the same name, but loading this package will still issue a namespace conflict warning, which is an undesirable side-effect). As recommended in the [rOpenSci guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#function-and-argument-naming), it would perhaps be better to simply prefix these with `rm_` (so `rm_assess`, `rm_score`, and `rm_coverage`). Note, however, that `rm_` is of course used as a [common prefix for remove-type functions](https://www.rdocumentation.org/search?q=rm_), although even then mostly only in the `qdapRegex` package, so still largely free otherwise. Maybe `prm_` for package risk metric?

The package seems still ""young"" enough that this could be done with little consequence. Just a thought ...

Happy to open any of these as individual issues if that would help focus work addressing any of these - just let me know. I'm really looking forward to using, breaking, and extending this fabulous package. Already much indebted to you!

I am encountering a peculiar situation. this goes back to a previous issue I raised about having trying to calculate the effect of multiple covariates. I was interested in the covariates whose calculated value had confidence interval that do not cross zero.

The issues was that with different initial estimates different covariates and different number of covariates were quantified, i.e. had a confidence interval that didn't cross zero. 

So I performed multiple runs with varying random seed and FOCEi. But in all of these I get the same estimation of proportional error to a 3 decimal place accuracy. the objective function is different, the BSV is different but the error remains the same. Is there a reason for that?

- [x] Improve main vignette characterization and clarity of core verbs
   > @mpadge #69 
   > The ""core verbs"" section serves no real purpose as is, because it does not explain what they are, and so leaves a reader doing little other than wondering what they are supposed to do with that section. I'm not sure whether you mean to imply that the core verbs are: `""assess""`, `""score""`, and `""summarise""`, or something else? The link to the Extending vignette does no help to clarify at that juncture.
- [x] Restructure ""assess"" section

- [x] Include an output of `all_assessments` 
   > @mpadge #69
   > clarify that available assessments can be seen with the all_assessments function, and then have a dump of the output of that in the vignette itself.
- [ ] Include an abbreviated ""Adding an Assessment"" section (from the ""extending-riskmetric"" vignette or link to ""extending-riskmetric"" vignette?
   > @mpadge #69
   > The text of the ""Adding and Assessment"" bit of the Extending vignette could very well live in the first vignette, where it would greatly help to understand the importance of Assessments at the outset.
- [x] Include an overview of the classes used within the riskmetric package and map the objects to the inputs/outputs of the ""core verbs""
   > @mpadge #69
   > It might help to explain in this first vignette the two primary classes of objects produced by the package: `pkg_ref` and `pkg_metric` objects, and explain how these are related to the `pkg_ref` -> `assess` -> `score` workflow. It would also seem to me to be necessary to explicitly describe the relationship between the output of assess and a pkg_metric object, because this is currently not explained anywhere, yet understanding that relationship would be of great help in understanding the overall package.
- [ ] Touch up `pkg_metric` documentation

  > ?pkg_metric, which is currently not particularly helpful
- [x] Consider reworking order of concept introduction to introduce the `pkg_ref` -> `pkg_metric` workflow earlier
   > @mpadge #69
   > In fact, it would probably help a lot to initially focus on a pkg_ref -> pkg_metric workflow. Once i understand that, then understanding `pkg_ref` -> `assess` becomes much easier, because assess just yields a meta-collection of `pkg_metric` objects. (The `pkg_metric()` function is in fact really useful at prying in under the hood here, so i really would suggest bringing that more to the (documentation) fore.

I think this is a valid concern given the over-generality of our naming conventions.

Given that these functions are more specific than their current names really warrant, I'd personally prefer to make the function names reflect the specificity instead of solving the problem by adding a package prefix. Perhaps we could consider something like:
- `assess_package` or `assess_metric`
- `score_package` or `score_metric`

@mpadge also highlighted our vestigial `coverage` function that I think is an artifact of some early work that was done to try to explore some coverage assessments well before the rest of the structure of the package was in place.

"pharmaR/riskmetric","Coersion of pkg_ref subclasses & related user-facing functions","https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric/issues/81","open",2020-01-15,2020-01-15,NA,0,"There's one lingering piece of the initial package scope that we have yet to implement, and it pertains specifically to situations where package metrics can _only_ be calculated with a subset of `pkg_ref` subclass objects. 

### Example

With a `pkg_source` object you have complete access to a clone of the package source code and could evaluate it against its test suite. We've talked about alternative ways of scraping code coverage for other `pkg_ref` classes, such as trying to strip the coverage percentage out of a badge of CI integration, but those might be misleading. Instead, with a `pkg_remote` package reference, it might be preferred to first coerce the `pkg_remote` to a `pkg_source` to evaluate a test suite yourself.

### Scope

This can be broken down into a few tasks:
1. Define casting operations between `pkg_ref` subclasses
2. Consider how to expose these casting operations to the user
3. Try to devise intuitive mechanisms of performing these casting operations automatically

### End User Experience

To the end user there are a couple different workflows:

1. A user creates a list of `pkg_ref`s, (e.g. `pkg_ref(c(""tidyr"", ""survival"", ""lme4""))`) and first calls some function to try to coerce them all to source references, using remote information as needed to try to find the source code and downloading the source code to a local temporary library. 

    This might look like:

    ```r
    pkg_ref(c(""tidyr"", ""survival"", ""lme4"")) %>%
      pkg_ref_cast(pkg_source()) %>%
      as_tibble() %>%
      assess() %>%
      ...
    ```   

    This method is probably more rigorous, as it is clear how the information is gathered.

2. A user defines logic by which metrics which can only be calculated with a subset of `pkg_ref` subclasses get coerced. For example, if a user says that they want to coerce `pkg_ref` subclasses such that the most possible metrics can be calculated, then `riskmetric` automatically handles the coersion to whichever subclass that is and runs all of the metrics. 

    This might look like:

    ```r
    pkg_ref(c(""tidyr"", ""survival"", ""lme4"")) %>%
      as_tibble() %>%
      assess(cast = cast_by_metric_coverage) %>%
      ...
    ```   

    This method might be preferred if a user wants things to work quickly. Specifically for situations where a metric is defined for multiple `pkg_ref` subclasses, but where one implementation is considered more robust than another, this method might not produce the most robust results without some sort of casting logic that takes this ""robustness"" into consideration, necessitating some sort of metadata about the metric that `riskmetric` can use to rank implementations.

here is a little writup on our requirements for Alluvial/Sankey plots which are often used for assessing patterns in patient flow, e.g., consecutively received treatments

There are some requirements for the plotting that one needs to take into account based on feedback we have received from scientists working with the output
* data wrangling and plotting should be 2 different functions
  * wrangling should result in a table with line of treatment, treatment name, pateint count and frequency (incl. those ""lost"" in each step)
  * visualisation then focus on showing that data as sankey plot
  * ideally, this is generic enough to not only focus on treatment, but any other kind of sequential data
* plotting functions should include annotation of plot with title (can be empty string), number of samples, and datasource in footnote
* has to work with the ggplot2 ecosystem (e.g., styling, adding titles etc.)
* shown data should include death/censoring, no later treatment (i.e., those patients lost to later observations)
* data needs to be interpretable in static form (containing information such as name of therapy and frequency)
* treatment groups should have meaningful order (or should be easily changeable)
* color scheme should match other analyses (i.e., fct. should have option to define custom color palette)
* _optional: interactive version can hide some of the annotation and make visible through mouse-over etc._

There are a few sankey packages out there that may be useful in this context. Selecting which one is up to the discretion of whoever writes the visr function:

* https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com/reference/geom_parallel_sets.html

#### Solutions

- I think we need to include `@importFrom utils .DollarNames` for `.DollarNames`. I didn't realize `.DollarNames` wasn't in base and/or had to be explicitly imported for S3 dispatch on another package's generic.
- Clean up some documentation, specifically for `bug_report_metadata` and `bug_reports_data`
- Track down where our duplicate Rd names are coming from.","dgkf",23,0

Namely, one critical one will be the checksum validation such that we can be extra rigorous about what source code or library install is actually being assessed. There's probably a lot we can learn (or use) from the [`renv` package's hashing techniques](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/blob/master/R/hash.R), potentially even using their hashing approach so that a library can be both installed and validated from an `renv.lock` file.

Each window is taken _as is_ and encoded using the associated autoencoder. This approach is geared towards search in a global context, i.e., find two peaks that appear as peaks in the global context. This requires the underlying distribution is roughly the same across the entire datasets.

In cases where this is not the case, it can be useful to allow instance-based normalization. I.e., prior to encoding a window, the window could be normalized based on its local neighborhood. This could theoretically be done prior to the search but it would be convenient if Peax supports this out of the box at runtime.","flekschas",479,479

The broader R Validation Hub will be planning to deliver a web app as a standalone tool for organization risk assessment report generation and they've asked that we give some guidance on what can be reliably built upon from `riskmetric`.

There are a few things we need to consider to help that team scope out their work.

### Metrics

So far we have these metrics completed or partially completed:
- downloads in last year (integer)
- exported objects with documentation (percentage)
- package has news (logical)
- package has vignettes (logical)
- status of last 30 reported bugs (percentage)
- license (NA - up to organization)
- news is current (logical)

We should scope out which metrics additionally need to be completed. At a minimum, we need to provide the expected output format of the metric assessment. Just to list a few, I would suggest the following as targets in increasing difficulty:

|Status|Metric|Notes|
|:-:|---|---|
|✅|has website|`$pkg_websites` implemented, still need `assess_has_website_url`, `score.pkg_metric_has_website_url`|
|✅|has BugReports| `$bug_reports_url` implemented, need `assess_has_bug_reports`, `score.pkg_metric_has_bug_reports` (#100)|
|✅|has a maintainer|`$maintainer` implemented, need `assess_has_maintainer`, `score.pkg_metric_has_maintainer` (#55)|
|✅|source code is public|`$source_control_url` implemented (but currently not visible due to bug addressed in #117), need `assess_has_source_control_url`, `score.pkg_metric_has_source_control_url` (#63)|
|❓|time since first release|`$archive_release_dates` implemented only for `cran_remote`s, scoring under consideration (#65, #85)|
|❓|time since version release|`$release_date` implemented, scoring under consideration (#65, #85)
| ✅|test coverage| finished for `pkg_install` only, `pkg_source` under consideration (#6)|

### Assessment Caching 

One thing that came up is the possibility of storing metric assessment scores as a data intermediate encompassing the time that the assessment occurred, the package metadata, assessed information and scored metrics. 

This might be deemed out of scope in the first pass, but if risk assessment times grow too long for an interactive app we may have to think about some ways to do caching. 

The easiest solution would be to save out the results dataset as a `.Rds`, but if generalizability is needed we might have to consider a machine readable intermediate. Given the focus on atomic intermediate assessment datastructures, I don't think this should be too difficult, but does pose additional development work. ","dgkf",468,385

At the moment, we mainly implement 2 or 3 digits after the decimal point, but this should probably be discussed further.
Do we want the number of digits to be sth. the user can specify in each function (risk: parameter creep) or enforce best practices? In the latter case, what would be the best practices we can agree upon with out scientists?

Several journals provide guidances, does anyone have any thoughts on which one's are preferable?
- Report to three significant digits (https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h1845). Here the size of the ratio is to use a rule based on significant digits. (adopting 2 decimals to all fractions makes the error larger for smaller ratios). Take the example—the ratio 1.23 with two decimal places and three significant digits. Dividing and multiplying it by 10 give 0.123 and 12.3, respectively, each still with three significant digits but with varying numbers of decimal places.

There may be some requirements making this a non-trivial task to automate, though, so it'd be great to have a discussion on this prior to implementation.

Some requirements that came up before
- colors should be used sparingly and only where needed to convey message
- colors should be consistent across visualisations  in the report (i.e., the same drug should always have the same color across a series of graphs)
- defaults needed for continuous and discrete variables
- ability to define specific colors for key variable values (e.g., drugs of particular interest, custom colors for factor values, ...)
- depending on use case: use corporate design colors as standard palette (parameterized by company or institution)
- colors should be discernible even if colorblind

To some extent, one could specify default color palettes at the beginning of the (rmarkdown) script using options for, e.g., ggplot2.continuous.colour and ggplot2.continuous.fill, but that would not account for most of the above customizations required for adhering to good graphics principles and our stakeholder requirements.

Does anyone have an idea how to best implement these requirements around colors and styling in the package? I guess we'd need to disentangle what could be meaningful defaults to be set at the document setup phase and what could be customized in a `vr_style_plot` function?","cschaerfe",417,0

Hi @gmbecker,

I have added circleci pipelines to the code and modified the code to make `R CMD CHECK` return 0 errors. To get to the 0 errors I have partly fixed code and partly commented out examples with adding a `TODO:` note.

Also note that with CI/CD we do not need to store the pkgdown website in `docs` in the repo as it can be found in the artifacts of circleci.

Currently circleci does the following

There are a number of dependencies that are nice to have throughout the package. Relatively lightweight, but convenient packages like `rvest` are good for making a number of remote operations easier. Having `tibble` and `pillar` make for a much nicer console interface when assessing multiple packages.

However, we also have a large number of metric specific packages and I expect this number to grow as we start pulling in more computationally intensive metrics. This includes packages like `covr`, `testthat`, `cyclocomp`. 

Perhaps we could think of a way of tagging assess functions with their package dependencies such that we can build a small onLoad dialog about what assess functions will be ignored until their additional Suggested package dependencies are installed? This would let us focus on a small set of minimal dependencies for general behaviors while still allowing for more complex functionality through package extensions. ","dgkf",86,0

### Configuration Summary

Based on the default config's presets, Renovate will:

  - Start dependency updates only once this onboarding PR is merged
  - Separate major versions of dependencies into individual branches/PRs
  - Do not separate patch and minor upgrades into separate PRs for the same dependency
  - Upgrade to unstable versions only if the existing version is unstable
  - Raise PRs immediately (after branch is created)
  - If semantic commits detected, use semantic commit type <code>fix</code> for dependencies and <code>chore</code> for all others
  - Keep existing branches updated even when not scheduled
  - Disable automerging feature - wait for humans to merge all PRs
  - Ignore `node_modules`, `bower_components`, `vendor` and various test/tests directories
  - Update existing lock files only when <code>package.json</code> is modified
  - Autodetect whether to pin dependencies or maintain ranges
  - Rate limit PR creation to a maximum of two per hour
  - Limit to maximum 20 open PRs at any time
  - Group known monorepo packages together
  - Use curated list of recommended non-monorepo package groupings

### Configuration Summary

Based on the default config's presets, Renovate will:

  - Start dependency updates only once this onboarding PR is merged
  - Separate major versions of dependencies into individual branches/PRs
  - Do not separate patch and minor upgrades into separate PRs for the same dependency
  - Upgrade to unstable versions only if the existing version is unstable
  - Raise PRs immediately (after branch is created)
  - If semantic commits detected, use semantic commit type <code>fix</code> for dependencies and <code>chore</code> for all others
  - Keep existing branches updated even when not scheduled
  - Disable automerging feature - wait for humans to merge all PRs
  - Ignore `node_modules`, `bower_components`, `vendor` and various test/tests directories
  - Update existing lock files only when <code>package.json</code> is modified
  - Autodetect whether to pin dependencies or maintain ranges
  - Rate limit PR creation to a maximum of two per hour
  - Limit to maximum 20 open PRs at any time
  - Group known monorepo packages together
  - Use curated list of recommended non-monorepo package groupings

Finally I have used Github Actions to set up CI workflow. I have set up basic CI workflow which is evaluating pipelines in linux and windows environment. Moreover actions/cache makes that CI workflow is much more faster (caching dependencies) 

Working on that I have met some troubles. During CI build, after installation of all newest versions of dependencies, Alluvial vignette throw mysterious error while running vr_alluvial_plot() function:
`The subscript 'tibble_vars[[i]]' has value 0 but must be a positive location.`.
I have been digging and It takes me a piece of time to find that it is as follows: 
function `easyalluvial::alluvial_long()` is calling inside` dplyr::select_if()` on tibble handling data where columns in the tibble are named using 'i' (iterator).  In the past there have been already problem like that: https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/4380 but this time I have found that it is not caused by updating of dplyr but latest tibble 3.0.0 released 16 days ago. When I force installation of previous version of  tibble in DESCRIPTION FILE then everything works fine. So it is temporary solution until tibble package team will not fix that.  

Also for some reason there has been problem with automate installing of : ""rstantools"", ""RBesT"", ""rcmdcheck"" and I decided to add a line with 'manual' installation before installing all dependencies what solved the case.  

For now package is build including vignettes and check throw:
0 errors ✔ | 8 warnings ✖ | 8 notes ✖
**so we have 0 errors but warnings need to be fixed.**

details are here: https://github.com/openpharma/visR/runs/587378443?check_suite_focus=true

For now CI build on GitHub Actions CI branch have failed only because I have set restrictive option : `error_on = ""warning""` . It is option what we need to discuss of course.  

In next step I will add CD part of workflow (rebuilding of docs file).","kawap",4,-1

To complete this metric, we need to add
- `assess_has_bug_reports_url`
   - I don't think we need any `pkg_ref` dispatch for this as any sub-class-specific behavior is handled in `pkg_ref_cache.bug_reports_url`
   - **returns:** a `character` value containing the BugReports field contents wrapped in a  `c(""pkg_metric_has_bug_reports_url"", ""pkg_metric"", ""character"")` S3 class (constructed using `pkg_metric()`)
- `score.pkg_metric_has_bug_reports_url`
   - **returns:** a `logical` value indicating whether the package has a BugReports field filled in

`pkg_ref_cache.bug_reports_url` was already added as part of #48

This might be an odd question but is there a way to introduce a cut off for the simulated values of the VPC?

What I mean is for example ignore all simulated values above some welfare limit (maximum tumour volume). Because obviously these are not present in the data whereas the models allows for them and that makes the VPCs look sub-optimal.

After installation of RxODE, I tried to validate the installation with the ""library(RxODE); rxTest();"" command under a R session. However, it found various problems and eventually it quit prematurely complaining too many problems found. These error are shown below:

However, the third test also generated many lines of warnings like below:

Please share code if possible.

vr_kaplan_meier_summary() generates the expected tables if I _do_ supply strata.

Not an issue exactly but more of a question on functionality. Is there a way to implement a restriction on the a covariate that extents to the individual values?

What I mean is that I have a parameter that needs to be between zero and one and not just the mean value THETA but all individual values (otherwise is mechanistically/biologically wrong). I was wondering if there is a way to impose that other than a transformation of the form:

Cov1<-exp(theta+eta)/(1+theta+eta)

Rightfully so. The warnings signal quite a bit of internal jargon and give no indication that they are expected behavior.

As mentioned in the discussion in #114 with @mpadge, and in a few emails I've received from users, these warnings seem to be missing the mark in terms of user reaction, so something isn't being communicated properly.

To mitigate this, I suggest adding a `pkg_metric_na` subclass similar to our existing `pkg_metric_error`. This will differentiate metrics which are explicitly not applicable from those that have not yet been implemented (maybe we should even have a `pkg_metric_todo`?). We could then choose how to handle these separately from errors and hopefully provide more meaningful output to the user.

Open for feedback on the design here, but I think it's worth experimenting with. ","dgkf",69,0

- `assess` => `pkg_assess`
- `summarize_risk` => `summarize_score`
- `pkg_score` applied to a `tbl_df` now also performs `summarize_score`, storing results in a hard-coded column, ""pkg_score""
- `riskmetric.Rmd` and `extending-riskmetric.Rmd` updated to reflect changes
- errors triggered through `bug_reports`, first logged in #108 fixed
- related to #108, improved error messages for errors caused within `scrape_bug_reports`
- `score.pkg_metric_has_bug_reports_url` changed to  returning a numeric instead of a logical to be consistent with other scores
- added `%||%` (common shorthand for ""if not NULL else"") to utils
- added safeguard to `pkg_metric` constructor disallowing accidental `structure(NULL, ...)` which will throw a warning. We should still aim to avoid this, though it shouldn't crop up accidentally now. ","dgkf",14,-294

The 30 values for `ccheck` results are the last 30 days of checks, with that Note occurring 12 times on each day. (""installed size"" Notes do not appear in `ccheck` results for some reason?). One of the primary motivations of `cchecks` is because CRAN often update their checks without warning, with authors only getting an email sometime after packages start failing. Accessing these services could provide an additional useful diagnostic.","mpadge",356,0

The only thing that immediately occurs to me is to add a model section akin to what is used in Stan with ""transformed parameters"".  In that, you could have any transformations that you want.  Perhaps adding some form of option to force a transform along those lines.

I added

```r
  back_transform(
    tvcl=exp,
    tvcl_ada=exp,
    .default=""automatic""
  )
```

Where the important parts that I think are:
* It is a list.
* The list has names that match the names of parameters.
* The values in the list are arbitrary functions where the numeric values is the first argument.  They can either by a normal function (e.g. `exp` in this case) or any user-defined function like `function(x) exp(-5*x) + 21`.
* There is some form of indicator (`.default` in the suggestion above) where the user can choose to make use of the automatic detection for all other parameters or turn off the automatic detection.

As it has nothing to do with the fitting itself, only the reporting, this should also be possible to modify on a completed model fit object.

When I just (accidentally) tried to fit a model with a single subject, I got the following error that wasn't clear as to the problem.

From a code-perspective, `statphi` here is expected to be a matrix, but it is not when there is a single subject.  I see two fixes that are preferred here, I think:

1. Catch single-subject data for an SAEM model earlier and give an informative error message.
2. Ensure that `statphi` is a matrix for the potential future state where SAEM models can be used to fit fixed-effect-only models.  As coded, it is a vector when `length(unique(ID)) == 1`.

I can't share the model, but the warnings that I saw at the end of minimization were:

```
Warning messages:

4: In (function (uif, data, est = NULL, control = list(), ..., sum.prod = FALSE,  :

```

The output that I got back in `fit_twocmt_ada$parFixed` only had columns for `Est.` and `Back-transformed` but not `Parameter`, `SE`, `%RSE`, `Back-transformed(95%CI)`, `BSV(CV%)`, or  `Shrink(SD)%`.  I understand that in this case, the model probably would not provide the following columns, `SE`, `%RSE`, and `Back-transformed(95%CI)`, but I would have expected them to be present but all `NA_character_` or `NA_real_` (for `$parFixed` or `$parFixedDf`, respectively).

Also, some but not all of the Back-transformed parameters were back-transformed.  Specifically, `tvcl` and `tvcl_ada` were not back-transformed while all the other log-scale parameters were correctly exponentiated.  As I am guessing it matters, the model looks like this:

I think that the ideal would be to catch this message and inform about what, if anything, is the problem.  As I was using this to try to generate a different reprex, I didn't think much about what the initial conditions or bounds were (not think much = just typed some numbers without looking at the data), so there is a great chance that this is due to horrible initial conditions relative to the data.  Watching the fit progress was an exercise in watching ODE solver and steepest descent solver pain.

Both nlmixr and RxODE have websites that do a lot to help people work with both tools.  I have not seen a guide that will help new users both start from scratch and get to deeper questions quickly.  (Not an easy balance to pull off.)

What I'm thinking of would likely be more nlmixr-focused, and it would link heavily into existing documents.  As an example, I think that this (https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/RxODE/articles/RxODE-intro.html) is a great introduction to RxODE and how it works, but as I had questions that went deeper, the next level of depth for articles tends to go into full depth immediately (e.g. this article on compartment number assignment, https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/RxODE/articles/RxODE-cmt.html, gives great depth but I would like to see an intermediate step between the intro and that).

The user guide element that I'm thinking of would cover approximately 80% of cases and point the user to the full documentation to reach 100%.

I assume that it should go into the pkgdown site, and if so, a quick pointer to where to get started would help (I've not used pkgdown before, but it looks like this would be a vignette.)","billdenney",364,363

The key is that the order that the parameter names are found in the function object the way that dynmodel traverses it is different than the order that I specified my parameters in.  In this example, the order of the initial values of `inits.err` is reversed relative to the order of the values in the `$ini` block.  (Specifically, `inits.err` is `c(add=3, prop=0.1)` when it should be `c(prop=0.1, add=3)`.)

The thing I'm having difficulty understanding is:
* Why do you need to loop over the model list?  (I think that the answer is to accommodate multiple endpoints, but I'm not sure.)
* Why can you not just use the error terms from the `$ini` block?  Why do they need to be regenerated here?  (And, what order should they be in?  I would assume that you could just use the `$ini` data.frame values for lower, est, and upper rather than looking in the equation for them.

This fixes #253 and fixes #322

Overall, it takes a much different approach to setting the initial conditions with code that traverses the parse tree for the initial conditions to set values.  It then generates a list of operations defined from the initial conditions, and takes those to generate the initial conditions data.frame.

Notable changes from the previous version are:

* Any valid R operation can be used to generate initial conditions.  A simple example like what is requested in #253 would be `tvCL <- log(20)`, but much more complex examples are also possible.
* Management of the way that fixed parameters are detected and assigned are much different.  As an example, it is now legal to do something like: `tvCL <- fixed(log(c(0, 10, 20))` or `tvCL <- log(c(0, fixed(10), 20)` or `tvCL <- log(c(0, 1/fixed(10), 20)` or `tvCL <- log(c(0, 1/fixed(mean(c(10, 20, 30))), 20))` or almost any other variant.
* Existing tests have been minimally modified to work with the current code.  Changes in tests include:
    * Some text is different mostly so that it is simpler to define the error.
    * Some text is different in that it is missing the parameter name (that could possibly be added back in).
    * Column classes are now consistent in the output data.frame, so reference result classes were changed.  (No other changes to reference results have been made.)","billdenney",1,-2

"nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr","backTransform() in ini block","https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/337","closed",2020-06-29,2020-11-23,2020-11-23,21,"As initially discussed in https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/322#issuecomment-650168520 :

I'd like to confirm what will occur with backTransform before implementing it (and it's easier to have it as a separate issue than to have it mixed in with the #322 discussion).

* Similar to `label()`, `backTransform()` will be an attribute that can be applied to a `theta`, `omega`, or `sigma` assignment.
* The backTransform attribute would be stored as a new list column in ini data.frame.  The elements of the list would be either `NULL` or a call.
* If there is no `backTransform()` attribute to the assignment, then the current code-detection method would be used.
    * No `backTransform()` attribute assignment would be stored as `NULL` in the ini data.frame.
* As the stored list element will not have an environment, we will need to be careful about the environment where it is evaluated.    I think that it should be `globalenv()`.
    * **Question**: Do you agree that the evaluation should be in `globalenv()` which would occur at the time of summary?
    * And if so, it would require the user to have the expected `backTransform()` environment available at the time of summary.  This would be a small hurdle if the model were saved in one session and summarized in a separate session, but that will be a problem for some user at some point.
* There are two ways (plus a combination of these) that I can imagine structuring the back-transform.  Which do you prefer (or do you see a preferred third way)?
   * A bare function call which will be evaluated with a single argument, such as: `backTransform(exp)` in the ini block would be evaluated as `exp(x)` when the back transformation occurs
    * A function call with a placeholder argument for the estimated parameter, such as: `backTransform(exp(.))` in the ini block would be evaluated as `exp(x)`.  More importantly, if another parameter were needed, it could be given like, `backTransform(dt(., df=10))`.
        * There are two options if no placeholder (`.` in this proposal) is present: then give an error (this may differ from expectations based on the magrittr pipe) or insert the parameter as an unnamed first argument (that is my preference as it seems more likely to align with expectations, and it is just as straight-forward to implement)..
    * And, the combination could also be possible where either is possible:  If given as a bare name (like, `exp`) evaluate it as a call with a single argument, and if given as a function call with a placeholder use that behavior.
* For back-transformation of omega blocks, I assume that the entire block would be passed as the argument to the back-transformation function rather than a single value at a time.
* If the user specifies the `backTransform()`, that would be used instead of the auto-detected back-transform.  (Always assume that the user knows best if they give information.)
    * Since the current behavior of back-transform relies on the model, in addition to the initial conditions, I think that both the default assignment of back-transformation and the assignment of the `err` column should occur in the same place in the code.  
    * **Question**: I don't know where the back-transform detection occurs in the current code.  Can you please help me find the correct location for assignment of both ""err"" and the current back-transform?","billdenney",147,0

(I'm not sure how someone would fix or unfix a parameter in an existing model, but from a quick look, that appears to be the main intent of that code.)

"nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr","(Long term) Feature Request: QR reparameterization to Improve Sampling Efficiency","https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/340","closed",2020-06-30,2020-08-01,2020-08-01,17,"nlmixr has many of the components already available that could be used to automatically perform QR-reparameterization as is done described in the Stan manual (https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_23/stan-users-guide/QR-reparameterization-section.html) and as I believe is done with the PsN `precond` command (https://github.com/UUPharmacometrics/PsN/releases/download/4.9.0/precond_userguide.pdf).

1. As a first step, this could likely be done with something like the way that the PsN precond command works where it occurs on a completed model, but
2. I could imagine a step better where the initial Hessian for the model is calculated based on the initial conditions, and that is then preconditioned, and that newly preconditioned model is what is actually estimated, or
3. It could occur at the end of estimation, similar to the way that `SADDLE_RESET` works with NONMEM, and
4. As a final augmentation, I could imagine that at every Hessian re-estimation (I assume Hessian re-estimations occur for at least some of the estimation types), it updates the preconditioning matrix and the estimate methods.

Doing this with a completed model sounds like it could be done approximately today with the `update()` command or even just code-generation from an existing model.  Doing this with the initial Hessian seems like it could be relatively feasible, if there is a way to get the Hessian before a model is first estimated.  Doing it during estimation seems... harder (and it may invalidate model estimation methods).

- Added `pkg_metric_na` subclass for when a metric is not applicable given the pkg_ref class
- Added `pkg_metric_todo` subclass for when a metric is appliable, but not yet implemented
- Added `pkg_metric_error` constructor, which was left to ad-hoc creation before
- Fixed bug when pulling a license from a remote CRAN/Bioconductor webpage (introduced `pkg_ref_cache.license`)
- Fixed bug with vignettes throwing an error when pulled from a CRAN/Bioconductor webpage
- Touched up some unit tests that were broken following our naming convention changes

There are likely several different subtle ways that nlmixr and drake do not interact well, and they can be parsed out into separate issues as it becomes the right time to try to fix them (as discussed in #311).

Other pointers to interaction issues are:

* ropensci/drake#910 (initial conditions cannot be set)
    * duplicate: ropensci/drake#1318
* #311
* #314

Generally, to work well with drake, code must be self-contained and must be able to restart without any external interactions.  Examples of typical errors are:

* Assignment to the global environment (or more generally an environment that is not local to the drake target)
* Loading external files and code from disk (for example, if a model was previously compiled, the cached, compiled model object may no longer exist)","billdenney",102,0

One straight-forward example is Beal's M3 method which I commonly use for handling concentrations below the limit of quantification.  Less simple examples include the use of discrete distributions for integer data and combinations of distributions for more complex data (one example recently was a triangular distribution plus a normal distribution to handle assay-related challenges).

`nlmixr` currently has a good number of distributions to handle a wide variety of common scenarios, but examples like my triangular plus normal distribution in my opinion should never be handled within the core of the project as they are too esoteric.

My thought is that a form like the following would be the way to make it happen:

```
cp~residCustom(fun_name=""string"", dv, ipred, ...)
```

(Argument order can be whatever makes the most sense.  I think that support for named arguments is almost a must to ensure that errors don't occur between C++ and R.)

Where:

* `residCustom()` is a pseudo-function that exists for use in `model` blocks to indicate that a custom R function will be called for calculating the likelihood.
* `fun_name` is a string argument indicating the function name in R to call.
* `dv` and `ipred` are the observed values and the predicted values.
* `...` are any other arguments needed to calculate the likelihood.

`fun_name(dv=dv, ipred=ipred, ...)` will return a likelihood (there could be an option for `residCustom()` to have it return likelihood up to a constant).  It must accept a vector of input values for each input and it must return a numeric vector the same length as `dv` and `ipred`.

As an example, the calling syntax for Beal's M3 method could be `Beal_M3(dv, ipred, lloq, sd)` where `dv` would come from the input data set, `lloq` would likely (but not necessarily) come from the input data set, and sd would be calculated as the vector of current standard deviations.

I realize that this would be slower than calculation directly in C++, but the user would inherently accept such a (hopefully small) speed hit for the flexibility.

For the simulation side of things, there would probably need to be some form of sampling indicator to `fun_name` (e.g. `fun_name(..., sample=TRUE)`.

I'm trying to make prediction-observation figures subset by or contingent on other data.  For that, I'm wanting to merge the post-hoc results back into the source data.  I think that the preferred method would be to use this:

```
foo <- nlmixr(model, data=data, est=""posthoc"")
```

or just to get the `$PRED` or `$IPRED` values from the fit object itself.

The issue that I'm coming up against is that I have 3 placebo subjects in the dataset who have no observations, but I want them there for other reasons.

When I estimate the model or try to do a posthoc estimate, I get the following warning:

```
4: In (function (uif, data, est = NULL, control = list(), ..., sum.prod = FALSE,  :
  IDs without observations dropped: 12 10 1
```

And, those subjects have no data in the output (the number of rows of `foo` is lower than the number of rows in `data`).

My feature request is that those subjects without observations are not dropped, but are set to `NA` in the output.  If that isn't reasonable or feasible, is there a preferred method for combining the data back together?  (Perhaps just convert it to a data.frame and merge it?)","billdenney",1,0

I'm not sure that is the correct behavior.

Specifically, both may apply to `omega` values where there can be multiple values assigned with a single `ini()` line.  I can imagine two scenarios where they could accept multiple arguments.

* A single value would apply across all arguments (the current behavior).
    * That will probably be wrong relative to what the user wants since it would apply for diagonal and off-diagonal omega values.
    * For labels, it is also probably wrong because I can't think of a scenario where a single label would correctly describe multiple items at the same time.
* For omega values, labels must equal the number of diagonals.
    * This seems like the rational choice, but maybe I'm missing something.  I never have wanted to name the correlation or covariance with anything other than the fact that it is a covariance and indicating the parameters that it is the covariance between.
* For omega values, `backTransform()`s would be assumed to be for the diagonals, and the off-diagonals would default to a correlation estimate.
    * If a single value, the assumption would be that the values were all either exponential or additive inter-individual variability.
    * Is there ever a rational assumption for off-diagonals other than correlation?  (I can't think of one off the top of my head.)","billdenney",348,345

This is based on #231. You offered a good solution, but I'm hoping it can be made easier.

Is there a way we can simplify multiple error model systax without requiring data manipulation? I'm porting some NONMEM models over to nlmixr and finding that the worst ones are those that define RUV with a THETA especially when there are covariate options that modify RUV. It seems nlmixr can only have errors that are defined as THETAs, which is like if NONMEM only allowed errors defined in $SIGMA. The known workarounds in NONMEM aren't consistent with the workaround for nlmixr so I'm worried it's not as intuitive as it can be.

Could we have it so a variable can be declared in the model that is valid to be used as the residual error term? Such as:

```
RUV_SD = TVRUV
if (DOSE>100) RUV_SD = 0.2 + TVRUV
...
linCmt()~add(RUV_SD)
```

It does not appear possible to run R CMD check on an installed package so I set a default pkg_ref method to return `NA`. 

I am wondering if `R CMD check` should be a separate assessment from CRAN/Bioc check summaries. 
  1. `R CMD check` can be run on any pkg_ref subclass (except pkg_install), in theory. 
  1. `R CMD check` and the CRAN/Bioc check summaries provide different information, IMHO
        1. `R CMD check` checks  whether the package will install on your system and if there are any potential problems with the install. For example, when I run `R CMD check` I get a warning for every package because I do not have the ‘qpdf’ package for checks on size reduction of PDFs.
        1. CRAN/Bioc checks summaries provides a snapshot of how a package would install on numerous systems, i.e. its portability. This to me is a different, albeit important potential metric. To me a package that is portable is of lower risk than one that is less portable.
  1. I thought about pulling individual checks from CRAN to match with the `R CMD check` but decided against it since we would have to match the users environment with the environments that CRAN runs the checks on and assume that they are the same which seems counter to proper risk assessment principles.","emilliman5",79,0

### Setup Objects
In setup-xyz.R I use two packages for each package type(Bioconductor remote isn't implemented yet).

- For source I embedded two packages to test for source packages. The first one is generally a ""good"" package with documentation and tests, the second is basically a single function and not much else.
- For installed packages I chose dplyr and utils. They should always be installed on a machine that is running tests for this packages.
- I'm still exploring options for HTTP mocking or other solutions in testthat for testing remote packages well. I have selected a couple packages that were reasonably popular and downloaded their CRAN page to the testing directory. This isn't perfect but it works pretty well.

Goal right now is to have a test_that for every assessment, reference, and score for each package type.




### Still TODO:

- Finish the rest of the assess tests
- All ref/cache tests
 - Better solution for testing remote/github API checks.

So far today I think I've exceeded my allowance for public github api requests, so it's now throwing errors, but I think it should be fine otherwise. However, I think we will have to look into spoofing the api endpoint so that we can decouple our tests from GitHub. 

For now I've disabled this test until we have something more reliable in the hopes of soon getting us back on track with some continuous integration to help with code review. 

I also took the liberty of removing some legacy tests we had in there from early on in the project. These were entirely commented out without any hope of reintegrating them, so I see no problem with removing them.  ","dgkf",3,0

It has been noted that some licenses are incompatible between them. Sometimes developers (and certainly CRAN) do not pay attention to this. It would be nice to have a metric that assess this. 

I've been working on a package [`compatibler`](https://github.com/llrs/compatibler) that aims to check if license are compatible but still is on early experimental/development process.

This is different from #53, as it does not only look at one package License but to all of its dependencies. On the bright site it will only need to be computed once for each package and can be cached. 

BTW to extract the information about packages there is the `available.packages()` function, there is no need to call the svn repository of CRAN and parse manually as I've seen on #53.","llrs",294,253

The testing was updated to the third edition of testthat. This is a bit ahead of what is on CRAN, but the improvements to snapshot testing makes it worth it in my opinion.

- A line was added to the description to note which edition of testthat is being used.
- I've moved the tests I've created to a folder where they won't get tested. I think the snapshots are the way to go for what we're testing.

Still todo:
1) You can run this three times without getting a 403 from github and causing the tests to fail so that is something I still have to work out.
2) Bioconductor packages are still something I want to target.

If that is not reasonable for some reason (we don't allow vectorized assignment, I don't think, so it shouldn't be a conflict, I don't think), then perhaps we could use something like `A(initial)` or `A(INIT)` or similar.

Since a LOT of files got changed, I want to direct you to the most important parts:
- `setup_mock_web_requests.R` has the code for setting up the various http endpoints and mocked responses
- `setup_test_packages.R` is where I create some packages for use throughout testing. This is sort of a merge of code I had previously and the prior `setup-xyz.R`
- A bunch of local files saved as prepared mock reponses are stored in `tests/testthat/test_webmocks/`
- test packages have been moved to a directory in `tests/testthat/test_packages/` and have been renamed to reflect a -""good"" and -""bad"" naming scheme used throughout for all `pkg_ref` subclasses for testing.
- snapshots have not been updated

If you can run the tests and things don't fail catastrophically, I think we're in good shape. If anything goes wrong, you should see errors suggesting that a stub web mock hasn't been set up for a given http request, but hopefully I've caught all those.

## Changes

### metric updates
- A few internal functions have changed from using `curl` to `httr` such that we can intercept web requests using `webmockr` and avoid hitting public APIs during testing runs
- Created a set of stub `pkg_refs` for testing, characterized as ""good"" or ""bad"" to try to test success and failure modes of each metric
- A minor update to `assess_has_vignettes` which would throw errors for remote `pkg_ref`s

### testing updates
- Added stubs for various cran- and github-related web requests that we issue throughout testing
- Added local versions of the http response for CRAN and GitHub responses
- Added function to generate cranlogs downloads response
- *TODO:* split cran responses into a representative ""good"" and ""bad"" remote package
- *TODO:* add bioconductor package testing

### tests
- Rewrote most tests to use these new, webmock'ed packages
- *TODO:* Update snapshots for snapshot tests after updates

---

Unit tests _almost_ pass, with only the snapshot tests now failing. I wanted to get input on the direction before making changes to the snapshots.

### Snapshot issues encountered:
1. Order of `pkg_ref` fields is critical to getting passing diffs. In a couple runs I encountered outputs that reordered the fields and diffs would get issued for just rearrangement, despite having no structural difference to the objects. I can dig into how we can make the output more consistent, but it doesn't seem like an immediate priority unless we are sure snapshots are absolutely necessary.
2. html parsed using `xml2` is stored as a a memory address pointer in R which will inevitably change between snapshots. 
3. `pkg_ref`s contain paths which will be inconsistent across individual machines and will trigger snapshot diffs
4. message output isn't captured, meaning that `<pkg_ref>$covr_coverage` won't be diff'ed in any meaningful way
5. downloads are calculated from the `Sys.Date()`, and will vary depending on the day on which the test suite is run.

### Other notes:
I thought that the message output from `covr::package_coverage` might have been the source of some test issues, so I wrote a wrapper to capture the messages, warnings, outputs and errors during code evaluation. I think this will be helpful for eventually building an audit log of all the operations that were performed, but for now it's just used for suppressing messages. It turned out these messages were just being triggered when testthat tries to print out the contents of a `<pkg_ref>$covr_coverage` for snapshotting. Oh well, I think this function will be useful later. ","dgkf",9,0
"openpharma/visR","GitHub Actions CI - store /docs in new repo","https://github.com/openpharma/visR/pull/66","closed",2020-09-18,2021-03-03,2020-11-19,6,"The CI_CD Action will now store the /docs folder in the new https://github.com/openpharma/visR-docs/ repo. 

The action will run checks, build the site and commit to a branch called `copied-docs` in the new repo. 

It does this on push to 
- `github_actions_ci` branch (this can be used as a branch name if looking to edit this Action)
- `develop`
- `master`

Along with this I deleted the /docs folder from this repo, as it's now stored elsewhere.
Also uncommented a line in the README which I think was causing issues before - seems to be fixed now.

Still to do with relation to this PR is change the source of the website to the new repo (in the Settings of the repositories) - this should happen pre-merge of this pull request so the website doesn't break when the docs folder in this repo is deleted, but I thought I should warn people before doing this.

It's worth noting that since the docs get pushed to the `copied-docs` branch (not straight to `master`), that any time the website needs to be updated, someone will need to manually merged that branch into `master` on `visR-docs`. I did this so that the website wouldn't just update every time someone pushes to a test branch - it's not a major concern but it does just mitigate someone breaking things without realising.

**Expected behavior:** The creation of a combined treatment group named ""Treated"", and accurately calculated summary statistics for all treatment groups. 

**Actual behavior:** While a new treatment group named ""Treated"" was created, and denominator counts and percentages were correctly calculated, this is not the case for the original two treatment groups. ""Xanomeline High Dose"" and ""Xanomeline Low Dose""  denominator counts are not being correctly calculated, causing the percentages to be rendered as ""(Inf%)"".

"Roche/rtables","add features to `make_afun` ","https://github.com/Roche/rtables/issues/77","closed",2020-10-02,2020-10-06,2020-10-05,5,"Thanks @gmbecker for `make_afun`, it looks pretty good already. However, in order to switch to using it in production, we would still need the following features for `make_afun`:

- I think this is more a bug, but also listing here: The labels that are passed from the statistics function result are not ending up in the table as they should. Example:
	```r
	s_summary <- function(x) {
	  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
	
	  list(
	    n = with_label(sum(!is.na(x)), ""N subjects""),
	    mean_sd = with_label(c(mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x)), ""My mean and SD""),
	    min_max = with_label(range(x), ""Range"")
	  )
	}
	a_summary <- make_afun(
	  s_summary,
	  .labels = c(n = ""n subjects""),  # only overwrite the label of the `n` statistics here.
	  .formats = c(n = ""xx"", mean_sd = ""xx.xx (xx.xx)"", min_max = ""xx.xx - xx.xx"")
	)
	basic_table() %>%
	  analyze(
	    ""Sepal.Length"",
	    afun = a_summary
	  ) %>%
	  build_table(iris)
	```
	Here we have labels ""n"", ""mean_sd"" and ""min_max"" instead of the expected ""n subjects"", ""My mean and SD"" and ""Range"".

- We need `indent_mods` functionality for `make_afun`, analogous to `formats` functionality (only nonnegative indent modification would be sufficient, compare current prototype we have internally in `tern`)

- I think it is nice to be able to change default arguments of the statistics function. However, would it be possible to make the logical step to also allow to set a new default for arguments that did not have a default earlier in the statistics function? Example:
	```r
	s_foo <- function(df, .N_col, a = 1, b = 2) {
	   list(
	      nrow_df = nrow(df),
	      .N_col = .N_col,
	      a = a,
	      b = b
	   )
	}
	a_foo <- make_afun(s_foo, .N_col = 40,
	 .formats = c(nrow_df = ""xx.xx"", "".N_col"" = ""xx."", a = ""xx"", b = ""xx.x""),
	 .labels = c(nrow_df = ""Nrow df"", "".N_col"" = ""n in cols"", a = ""a value"", b = ""b value"")
	)
	a_foo(iris)
	```
	does not work currently.

- When handling reference columns we need to be able to pass empty strings instead of
numbers from a statistics function. In that case, the `afun` returned by `make_afun` should handle that case by changing the format to `""xx""` and not use the usually numeric format which will fail in the table production step. (I could imagine that this might be also solved by modifying the general interpretation of formats to not do anything when a string is detected.) Note that we cannot work with `NULL` instead of strings because that does not allow attributes which we need for passing labels.

	Example:
	```r
	s_summary_ref <- function(x, .in_ref_col) {
	  list(
        n = with_label(`if`(in_ref_col, """", length(x)), ""Number of patients""),
        mean = with_label(`if`(in_ref_col, """", mean(x)), ""Mean""),
        median = with_label(`if`(in_ref_col, """", median(x)), ""Median"")
      )
	}
	a_summary_ref <- make_afun(
	  s_summary_ref,
	  .formats = c(n = ""xx"", mean_sd = ""xx.xx (xx.xx)"", min_max = ""xx.xx - xx.xx"")
	)
	basic_table() %>%
	  split_cols_by(""Species"", ref_group = ""setosa"") %>%
	  analyze(""Sepal.Length"", afun = a_summary_ref) %>%

"pharmaR/riskmetric","New Maintenance Metrics regarding Frequency of Version Releases","https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric/issues/168","open",2020-10-08,2021-02-23,NA,2,"Greetings!

While working on the risk assessment shiny app, we had some good discussion regarding new maintenance metrics we'd like to suggest:

- **(1) number of version releases**
- **(2) average / median number of months between releases**

The thought rationale actually came about while discussing our plot on the community usage tab (see plots below). As you can see, there are packages, like `dplyr` that have frequent version releases within a year and other packages like `bshazard` that have zero. Knowing that a package is constantly being improved (like `dplyr`) shows that the maintainers are very active, which is a good sign from a risk perspective. However, a package that hasn't been updated in a while (like 28 months for `bshazard`) for example may pose a potential risk. Let me explain: either the package is really simple and doesn't require much maintenance (low risk) OR the maintainer has abandoned his/ her post (high risk)!

Second, having **number of versions** and **avg months between releases** will also help bring into context the version maturity figure below. At first glance, a risk assessment shiny app user may think that only 1 month since release is really risky, but not until they realize that `dplyr` actually churns out new releases on monthly or bi-monthly cadence.

Thoughts?

However, there are several aspects we need to consider, for example:
- general flexibility, 
- the tradeoff between ease of use if data follows the standard vs. if it does not
- how easy it is to learn and understand

Generally, I would suggest not to make strong assumptions about column names. Then again, if we have to make assumptions it is a good idea to follow the standard. Also, I think we should have parameter names that are easy to read and to understand, especially for people familiar with survival analysis but not necessarily with the standard. 

The easiest solution would probably be using the column names from the ADaM standard as default values and using simple parameter names that are meaningful in a functional way.

vr_KM_est(data = adtte, strata = ""TRTP"")

My approach was to have three logical variables representing the three analysis columns, and then use `analyze_colvars`. The problem there is that the row split (e.g. ""ALOPECIA"") gets its own row, but I would like to have the percentage from `analyze_colvars` in the same row as the row split label. Then I thought of `summarize_row_groups` but that cannot handle the different column variables distinctly, i.e. the summary is the same across the 3 analysis columns.

Is there something missing here in terms of feature? Or am I missing something?","danielinteractive",1,-1

The key points are:
- Different classes model estimation / necessary calculations (implemented in the vr_KM_est.R) and plotting (vr_plot.R)
- Very generic plotting (vr_plot.R) and generic plotting-helpers (e.g. add_CI), with also consistent and clear naming.
- Use of the general tidyverse philosophy and especially the pipe operator.

A next step could be adding refactoring another plotting function to be integrated into the existing API, for example, the alluvial
The next steps would then be:
- Changing the referencing of column names. Right now they are renamed in the data.frame, I would use the parameter names instead (cf. issue 82).
- Creating an object for the result of the precalculations necessary to plot the alluvial (function vr_alluvial_wrangling).
- Separate alluvial base plot from addons (like adding the N) to have the same calling structure as in the survival example.
- Integrating the alluvial plotting into the vr_plot method.
Each point would be a separate github issue but I don't want to clutter the issue list before we have decided if we do it like this

**What is your idea for a new plot/table?**
Not only meta-analyses, but also cohort overviews or results of cox PH models and other regression models are often shown in ForestPlots. @bailliem had some initial ideas, but we haven't gotten around to fully implement this visualisation and help would be appreciated

**Do you have any examples you can share of what it looks like?**
Example for Cox PH Model (example from [forestmodel](https://github.com/NikNakk/forestmodel))

**What potential packages/functions could be used to make this plot?**
There are the [forestplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forestplot/vignettes/forestplot.html) and [forestmodel](https://github.com/NikNakk/forestmodel) packages on CRAN as well as potentially some good ideas in the [ggforest function of the survminer package](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/survminer/reference/ggforest.html). Ideally, this would be implemented using ggplot2 only.

**Are you interested to implement this yourself?**

`pkg_list <- pkg_ref(setNames(c(""ggplot2"", ""limma""), c(""cran"", ""bioc"")))` #named list

Example: tidyverse and all its dependency

Step 1: identify the package list (total 88 packages)

```
# Those packages will be directly used 
pkgs <- c(""broom"", ""cli"", ""crayon"", ""dbplyr"", ""dplyr"", ""forcats"", ""ggplot2"", 
          ""haven"", ""hms"", ""httr"", ""jsonlite"", ""lubridate"", ""magrittr"",

```
# All dependency packages

pkg_avail <- available.packages(contriburl = contrib.url(repo))
all_pkgs <- miniCRAN::pkgDep(pkgs, 
                               availPkgs = pkg_avail,
                               repos = repo,

all_pkgs <- all_pkgs[! all_pkgs %in% base_pkg()]
```
Step 2: run `riskmetric` for each of the package independently
Step 3: run package `assess` and `score` for each package
Step 4: calculate the overall risk of the cohort. Weight can be set based on the type of package. (e.g. directly used by user, dependency package)

For such cases, we would like to come up with an approach to prune based on table data but also taking into account the metadata.

Example:
```r
df <- data.frame(
  arm = c(""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""a"", ""b"", ""c""),
  discont = factor(c(""dropout"", ""none"", ""none"", ""adverse"", ""moving"", ""none""), 
                   levels = c(""none"", ""dropout"", ""moving"", ""notime"", ""adverse"", ""death"", ""ill"", ""reaction"")),
  discont_group = factor(c(""other"", ""none"", ""none"", ""safety"", ""other"", ""none""))
)

tab <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by(""arm"") %>%
  split_rows_by(""discont_group"", split_fun = keep_split_levels(c(""safety"", ""other""))) %>%
  split_rows_by(""discont"") %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  build_table(df)
tab
prune_table(tab)
```

Now here the problem is:
- `tab` is too large, i.e. contains many rows which don't have observations and which are not possible at all. For example, there can't be a row under ""safety"" which is ""moving"".
- `prune_table(tab)` (which somehow kills everything here, but supposing it works) would be too small, i.e. does not contain rows we would like to show having 0s. For example, we would like to keep the row ""death"" under ""safety"" to show that it did not happen here.

So the question is how do we include best the requirement here to have specific levels shown for the 2nd factor given the value of the 1st factor?","danielinteractive",175,0

I can give more context in our meeting next week, but basically a question came up regarding the colvars layout. Is it possible to have something analogous to `summarize_row_groups` where the `cfun` would be a list populating different columns differently? (so similar to `analyze_colvars` where `afun` can be a list of `afun`s doing different things for different columns, but displaying the results in line with the split label of the levels).

We have a couple of table layouts where such a feature would be needed and useful. Just wanted to check if I oversaw some functionality in rtables that can do this (which might well be the case).

Thanks,
cheers

"Roche/rtables","`make_afun` when stats function is a generic with method-depending results","https://github.com/Roche/rtables/issues/116","closed",2020-10-26,2020-11-05,2020-11-05,7,"Hi @gmbecker ,

we have the situation that we have a generic summary function as statistics function with methods depending on the class of input vector `x`. If the variable `x` is a numeric, e.g. mean and sd are returned as statistics, but if the variable is a factor, then a list of counts and another list of counts and fractions might be returned.

Now with `make_afun` interface there are problems:

- We can only set `.formats` to things that will definitely be returned by the stats function. That means we can't set formats for numeric and factor return statistics at the same time, because only one set would be returned. 

- We cannot set `.ungroup_stats` to count and count_fraction just like that because even if `x` is a factor then only one of them might be selected via `.stats`. (This problem is not specific to the generic stats fun situation but another similar symptom of failing assertions)

How should we move forward?

I did change the name of the fit from fit_linCmt_nlme to fit_ode_nlme in the code below. Maybe it was not intended to use the ode version of the model in the nlme example? The ode version of the model works fine when using saem. However, saem takes about six minutes on my system, even with the reduced iterations and only uses one core.

``` r
library(nlmixr)
f_ode <- function(){
    ini({
        lCl <- 1.6      #log Cl (L/hr)
        lVc <- log(90)   #log Vc (L)
        lKA <- 0.1      #log Ka (1/hr)
        prop.err <- c(0, 0.2, 1)
        eta.Cl ~ 0.1 ## BSV Cl
        eta.Vc ~ 0.1 ## BSV Vc
        eta.KA ~ 0.1 ## BSV Ka
    })
    model({
        ## First parameters are defined in terms of the initial estimates
        ## parameter names.
        Cl <- exp(lCl + eta.Cl)
        Vc = exp(lVc + eta.Vc)
        KA <- exp(lKA + eta.KA)
        ## After the differential equations are defined
        kel <- Cl / Vc;
        d/dt(depot)    = -KA*depot;
        d/dt(centr)  =  KA*depot-kel*centr;
        ## And the concentration is then calculated
        cp = centr / Vc;
        ## Last, nlmixr is told that the plasma concentration follows
        ## a proportional error (estimated by the parameter prop.err)
        cp ~ prop(prop.err)
    })

"nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr","Multiple endpoints with ALAG in FOCEI estimation problem","https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/429","closed",2020-11-02,2020-11-24,2020-11-08,47,"Running: nlmixr_1.1.1-9, RxODE_0.9.2-2 and n1qn1_6.0.1-9

I have a model with multiple endpoints in which both ALAG and F need to be estimated, but there is no sensitivity on either of those variables. The model runs fine if I do one of the following:

- ALAG is removed,
- Only one endpoint is predicted, or
- FO is used

Otherwise, the following error message occurs:
```
Error in .fitFun(.ret) : 
  Evaluation error: Infinite/NaN while evaluating initial objective function.
Restart 1
Error in .fitFun(.ret) : 
  Not compatible with requested type: [type=list; target=double].
Restart 2
Error in .fitFun(.ret) : 
  Not compatible with requested type: [type=list; target=double].
Restart 3
Error in .fitFun(.ret) : 
  Not compatible with requested type: [type=list; target=double].
Error in (function (data, inits, PKpars, model = NULL, pred = NULL, err = NULL,  : 
  Could not fit data.
```
F doesn't seem to be causing any problems, but I figured it should be mentioned since it's in the same ""family"" of parameters.

I can't share the model, but I was able to reproduce the issue with the warfarin model you've used for previous demos:

This model runs and converges to reasonable estimates if I do any of the modifications I mentioned earlier. It will also run if talag is unbounded, initialized as `talag <- 0`, but it converges on -1.433e-14 and the other variables basically don't change.

The model also returns the same error even if talag is fixed to some value.

```r
basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by_multivar(c(""AGE"", ""AGE""), varlabels = c(""Age"", ""Biomarker 1"")) %>%
  analyze_colvars(afun  = mean, format = ""xx.x"") %>%

```

gives twice ""Age"" as label for the columns. Note that the use case for such duplicated/ dummy `vars` is often that we just use the whole `df` in the `afun` and not one specific variable. So in order to fix this kind of thing, it might be cleaner mid term to not require specification of variables when using `split_cols_by_multivar`.

Following our discussion, I also tried something with a `add_combo_levels` and `select_all_levels` combination:

```r
library(tibble)
combodf <- tribble(

  ""A_B"", ""Arms A+B"", select_all_levels, list(),
  ""A_C"", ""Arms A+C"", select_all_levels, list()

colfuns <- list(function(x) rcell(mean(x), format = ""xx.x""),
                function(x) rcell(sum(x > .5), format = ""xx""))
l <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by(""ARM"", split_fun = add_combo_levels(combodf, keep_levels = combodf$valname)) %>%
  analyze_colvars(colfuns)

but that fails.

"pharmaR/riskmetric","method for 'pkg_ref_cache.description' applied to pkg_remote","https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric/issues/178","open",2020-11-06,2020-11-12,NA,6,"Greetings.

I have been working with @marlycormar on the `risk_assessment` package, and due to some changes we've been working on,
I noticed the `pkg_remote` method had not been defined for `pkg_ref_cache.description`

And I am offering to write one and create a PR for it.
Below is a rough draft.   Currently, the `risk_assessment` package only needs a few fields, such as version, author, maintainer, license and published date.  So the function I have written so far works for `risk_assessment`.

But for `riskmetric` I believe the function/method should web-scrape every name-value pair it finds, just like we were pulling every field out of a `DESCRIPTION` file.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pkg_ref_cache.description.pkg_remote <- function(x, name, ...) {

  webpage <-
    read_html(paste0(
      x$repo_base_url,""/package="",x$name
    ))
  
  title_html <- html_nodes(webpage, 'h2')
  title <- html_text(title_html)
  # remove line breaks, single and double quotes
  title <- str_replace_all(title, c(""\n |'|\""""),"""") 
  
  desc_html <- html_nodes(webpage, 'p')
  desc <- html_text(desc_html)
  desc <- desc[1]
  desc <- str_replace_all(desc, c(""\n |'|\""""), """") 
  
  maintainer_xpath <- ""//td[.='Maintainer:']/following::td[1]""
  main <- xml2::xml_text(xml2::xml_find_all(webpage, maintainer_xpath))

  auth <- xml2::xml_text(xml2::xml_find_all(webpage, author_xpath))

Unlike [`drake`](https://github.com/wlandau/drake), [`targets`](https://github.com/wlandau/targets) makes it super straightforward to build extensions for specialized use cases. For example, I recently created a new R package called [`stantargets`](https://github.com/wlandau/stantargets), which combines [`targets`](https://github.com/wlandau/targets) with [`cmdstanr`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr) to make it easy to write large Bayesian data analysis pipelines. Complicated workflows like [this one](https://github.com/wlandau/targets-stan/blob/main/_targets.R) condense down to [this one](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets/articles/mcmc_rep.html) without loss of technical sophistication or computing power. The former requires users to think carefully about dynamic branching and file tracking, and the latter uses domain knowledge to abstract away these intimidating concepts.

I thought you might like to know because it instantiates a successful pattern that my colleagues and I are actively pursuing: develop one general-purpose pipeline tool first, and then build friendlier methodology-specific workflow frameworks on top of that. Other possibilities include [`stantargets`](https://github.com/wlandau/stantargets)-like packages for JAGS, Greta, Keras, Torch, Tidymodels, etc. For you, I see potential in a [`stantargets`](https://github.com/wlandau/stantargets)-like package tailored to `nlmixr`. I do not have the domain knowledge to develop it myself, but I would be happy to discuss ideas and review code if this direction appeals to you.","wlandau",293,1

the row and col paths are full paths to a cell however the return value is a list instead of only the nubmer.

I think that if both row and col paths are such that they determine a single cell we should drop the list, do you agree? If so, would you mind adding that to cell_values?

we found the following issue in the latest rtables:

```r
col_counts <- c(`ARM A` = 103L, `ARM B` = 98L, `ARM C` = 94L)
df_factor <- data.frame(ARM = c(""ARM C"", ""ARM B"", ""ARM A""), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
df_character <- data.frame(ARM = c(""ARM C"", ""ARM B"", ""ARM A""), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

lyt <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by(var = ""ARM"") %>%
  add_colcounts()

result_factor <- build_table(
  lyt = lyt,
  df = df_factor,
  col_counts = col_counts
)
result_factor

result_character <- build_table(
  lyt = lyt,
  df = df_character,
  col_counts = col_counts
)
result_character
```

Here `result_character` puts the ""ARM C"" first (apparently because it first appears in the data set) but still puts the column count for ""ARM A"" in the first column. 
Most users would expect that 1) the column order is according to a default factor conversion, i.e. having ""ARM A"" in the first column and 2) using provided names in `col_counts` to match with the columns. Not sure if that would be easy to fix? Thanks, cheers, Daniel","danielinteractive",2,0

I'm new to nlmixr, just wondering if there is a way to specify `amt` in the model statement? i.e. the differential equation is a function of the initial dose, e.g. 
`d/dt(s) = (a * amt)/(b + amt) * s`
This example has analytical solution, but I need a general solution for analytically unsolvable differential equations.

I am looking at using Tplyr to validate tables created in SAS

I am not having issues comparing medians and other percentiles because I am using
`options(tplyr.quantile_type = 3)`

But sometimes the data generated by the `group_count()` layer
`set_count_layer_formats(n_counts = f_str(""xx (xxx%)"", n, pct))`
is off by a digit.  And `Proc Compare` throws it out, causing it to ""fail"" validation.

I had been reading this blog by Ali Dootson
[TFL programming in R versus SAS](https://www.d-wise.com/blog/tfl-programming-in-r-versus-sas)

And found a function they wrote that emulates SAS rounding.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ut_round <- function(x, n=0)
{
 # x is the value to be rounded
 # n is the precision of the rounding
 scale <- 10^n
 y <- trunc(x * scale + sign(x) * 0.5) / scale
 # Return the rounded number
 return(y)
}
```
I have been using this to post-process the Tplyr tibble created and update the `nnn (nnn%)` strings
so I can get `Proc Compare` to accept the results.

Any chance you could come up with an alternate rounding option?
Perhaps something like
`options(tpylr.rounding = {default|SAS}`?

Right now I am only seeing the issue with percentages generated in `group_count()`

Thanks so much!

I noticed the package has been removed from the CRAN.
I read that this depends on another package, RxODE.
Do you plan to restore it to the central R repository? How would you estimate it? Weeks, months - this year?

This is incredibly awesome package, it would be a great loss if it's removed permanently from the CRAN. Why? I have to follow SOPs that disallow installation anything outside the CRAN or that is not ""active"" on the CRAN (I mean that only archival versions are available). I requested the SOP to be changed, but it may take months...

fit.s$eta
```
These extracted eta values from 'fit.s' were put into following script to do a simulation 
```
ev <- eventTable() %>% 
  add.dosing(dose=2, nbr.doses=1, dosing.interval = 12, rate=0.8) %>% 
  add.sampling(0:480)
 
ev_exeta <- cbind(ev, fit.s$eta)

sim_res <- rxSolve(fit.s, events=ev_exeta, nSub=1)
```

This code worked in RxODE v1.0.0-0 and nlmixr v2.0.0

but with the most recent version v1.0.2 and v2.0.1 each, it yields following error and simulation is aborted...

seems like it implies that some object is missing.

I am curious if it is possible to deploy nlmixr-based shiny app to servers like Shinyapps.io? And how?

I have built a model with nlmixr and embedded it into a shiny dashboard to interactively visualize the estimation output. Everything runs perfectly locally, but on the Shiny server, it fails. I tried the method described in the link [here](https://github.com/ranikay/shiny-reticulate-app) (used the same `.Rprofile` and only changed `PYTHON_DEPENDENCIES = c('sympy')`), but it still doesn't work.

Any ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated! ","leojanetguo",2,0

Tests were added to make sure the right option is selected by default and can be changed. Also tests support for multiple packages with different sources.","elimillera",48,0

It looked like no types of fit worked for me. Does RxODE support if/else in the model? why SAEM sees it as time-varying covariate?

""LCL"", ""UCL"" and ""CI"" are allowed to be part of the statlist argument in the get_summary function, and by default all three are.
When CL or CI are a part if the statlist (l.55-61) ...
(""conf.int"" %in% names(survfit_object) &
      survfit_object[[""conf.type""]] != ""none"" &
      ((base::any(grepl(
        ""CL"", statlist, fixed = TRUE
      ))) | (base::any(grepl(
        ""CI"", statlist, fixed = TRUE
      )))))
...they are changed to something like ""0.95CI"" or ""0.95CL"". And this happens also if only one of these stats is there (l.62-67):
CI <-
      paste0(survfit_object[[""conf.int""]], statlist[grepl(""CL"", statlist, fixed = TRUE)])
    statlist[grepl(""CL"", statlist, fixed = TRUE)] <- CI
    CI_Varname <-
      paste0(survfit_object[[""conf.int""]], statlist[grepl(""CI"", statlist, fixed = TRUE)])
    statlist[grepl(""CI"", statlist, fixed = TRUE)] <- CI_Varname

In line 99 then CI_Varname is used independently of whether it was set or not (see condition l.55-61).

#### Steps to reproduce the issue
#works:
get_summary(survfit_object)

#breaks sometimes; cannot reproduce:
get_summary(survfit_object, statlist = c('median'))

#breaks always
get_summary(survfit_object, statlist = c('events', 'median', 'CI'))
--> Error: Problem with `mutate()` input `0.95CI`.

"Roche/rtables","Add functionality to split sub-tables by page","https://github.com/Roche/rtables/issues/163","open",2021-02-01,2021-03-03,NA,2,"Would it be possible to define the concept of splitting by a ""page"" variable in table layouts?

This would be similar to existing `split_col_by` and `split_row_by` with the following requirements:

- Display variable level in the header of the sub-table (eg ""ARM: A: Drug X"" in example below).
- When printing the table, introduce page breaks when the level of the split variable changes.

Some sample code to do this could look like:
```
basic_table() %>%
  split_rows_by(""ARM"", type = ""page"") %>%
  split_rows_by(""COUNTRY"") %>%
  analyze(""AEBODSYS"") %>%
  build_table(adae)

"Novartis/xgxr","geom_smooth with method ""nls"" not producing desired behavior","https://github.com/Novartis/xgxr/issues/40","closed",2021-02-02,2021-02-04,2021-02-03,4,"geom_smooth with method = ""nls"" does not produce desired behavior. The issue has been isolated to the definition of predictdf.nls function, which works when sourced to .GlobalEnv, or when compiled in the package with R 3.6.1 and ggplot2 3.2.1, but does not work when compiled within the package with R 4.0.2 and ggplot2 3.3.2. Details below.

Function predictdf.nls was created to provide mean and confidence intervals from a nls fit to supply to geom_smooth. Because of the  naming of the predictdf.nls function, geom_smooth is supposed to call it automatically (similar to how geom_smooth calls predictdf.glm & predictdf.loess depending on the method). It was working perfectly fine for ggplot2 v3.2.1 / R v3.6.1, but somewhere between there and ggplot2 v3.3.2 / R v4.0.2 it’s now broken. Below are details on when it does and does not work. 

Details on when it does and does not work:
-	**Works**: If we install our package with this function in side in R v3.6.1 / ggplot2 v3.2.1, and run the example, it produces the plot with an Emax fit through the data including CI as it should.
-	**Doesn’t work**: If we install our package with this function inside in R v4.0.2 / ggplot2 v3.3.2, and run the example, we get the following warning message, and the Emax fit and CI fail to appear in the graph: 
> Warning message:
> Computation failed in `stat_smooth()`:
> $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors 
-	**Works**: If however, we source the predictdf.nls function directly in the .GlobalEnv in R v4.0.2 / ggplot2 v3.3.2, then the example works perfectly fine, does not return the warning, and produces the appropriate plot including CI. 

There is some communication issue between the package-defined predictdf.nls function and the ggplot2 geom_smooth function which I don’t understand.

Below is the function and example code.

```
#' Prediction data frame for nls
#' 
#' Get predictions with standard errors into data frame for use with geom_smooth
#'
#' \code{ggplot2::geom_smooth} produces confidence intervals by silently calling functions 
#' of the form predictdf.method, where method is ""loess"", ""lm"", ""glm"" etc. 
#' depending on what method is specified in the call to \code{geom_smooth}. 
#' Currently \code{ggplot2} does not define a \code{predictdf.nls} function for method of type ""nls"", 
#' and thus confidence intervals cannot be automatically generated by \code{geom_smooth} 
#' for method = ""nls"". Here we define \code{predictdf.nls} for calculating the confidence 
#' intervals of an object of type nls. \code{geom_smooth} will silently call this function 
#' whenever method = ""nls"", and produce the appropriate confidence intervals.
#'

It would be good to have something like a `.in_ref_row` variable populated that the user can define when defining a row split, similarly as we have `.in_ref_col` for column split. 

Examples:

(1) If we summarize change from baseline (""CHG"" variable), we don't want to have 0s displayed when being in the reference row, i.e. baseline visit here:

```r

  filter(AVISIT != ""SCREENING"")

basic_table() %>%

  split_rows_by(""AVISIT"", split_fun = drop_split_levels) %>%
  analyze(""CHG"") %>%
  build_table(anl)

1. In get_risktable the survival object is taken from a call object:
survfit_object <- eval(gg$data$call[[1]])
However, the result of gg$data$call[[1]] is:survfit(formula = survival::Surv(AVAL, 1 - CNSR) ~ TRTP, data = adtte)but surfvit is not known. The only solution I could find was:call = as.character(gg$data$call[[1]])
text=eval(expr=paste0(""survival::"", call[1], ""(formula = "", call[2], "", data = "", call[3], "")""))
eval(parse(text=text))
This is a bit cumbersome and also I make assumptions about the form I don't know I should be makinghere. Still, this I pushed to the branch fix_package_dependencies.

---------------------  FIX NEEDED! --------------------- 
2. In add_risktable (l. 154) there is a call of the function AlignPlots(). I have trouble finding out where this function comes from. There is a function cowplot::align_plots, but this function does not produce the same result.

I'm receiving errors when trying to run the examples for this package, either independently via `tools::testInstalledPackage(""MAIC"", types = ""examples"")` or as part of `R CMD check` (via `devtools::check(""./MAIC"")`).

### Using `testInstalledPackage`

When using `testInstalledPackage`, I get an error about the use of `T`. During example execution, `T` and `F` are masked with code that will throw these errors when they're used ([from R email list](https://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/R-CMD-check-quot-T-used-instead-of-TRUE-quot-td911063.html)). 

```r
> KM_plot <- ggsurvplot(KM_list,
+                       combine = TRUE,
+                       risk.table=T, # numbers at risk displayed on the plot
+                       break.x.by=50,
+                       xlab=""Time (days)"",
+                       censor=FALSE,
+                       legend.title = ""Treatment"",
+                       title = ""Kaplan-Meier plot of overall survival"",
+                       legend.labs=c(""Intervention"",
+                                     ""Intervention weighted"",
+                                     ""Comparator""),
+                       font.legend = list(size = 10)) +
+   guides(colour=guide_legend(nrow = 2))
Error in ggsurvplot(KM_list, combine = TRUE, risk.table = T, break.x.by = 50,  : 
  T used instead of TRUE
```

### Using `R CMD check`

A simple enough issue, but currently throwing errors. Fixed by adding `Suggests: knitr` to `DESCRIPTION`

```
VignetteBuilder package not declared: ‘knitr’
```

### Using `devtools::check(""./MAIC"", vignettes = FALSE)`

When running R CMD check I get namespace errors, which may be due to the masking of `.oldSearch` in the check environment. 

```
  > library(MAIC)
  > library(ggplot2)
  > library(survminer)
  Loading required package: ggpubr
  Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘ggpubr’ in loadNamespace(j <- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[j]]):
   there is no package called ‘foreign’
  Error: package ‘ggpubr’ could not be loaded
  Execution halted
```

I think that this might be a result of these undeclared dependencies required to run the examples. Even if these are installed in my library, they aren't being picked up while running the examples during `R CMD check`. I was able to fix this by adding these three dependencies as `Suggests:` dependencies. With these added, I get the same error as when running `tools::testInstalledPackages` (the issue with using `T` in examples)

I have some problems with fitting a model with a proportional error using saem. At first, I thought it was the problem with my data, but it also occurs with the theo_sd dataset. I've used a simple 1-cmt model for this example:

one.cmt <- function() {
        ini({
                tka <- 0.45 
                tcl <- log(c(0, 2.7, 100)) 
                tv <- 3.45
                eta.ka ~ 0.6
                eta.cl ~ 0.3
                eta.v ~ 0.1
                prop.sd <- 0.7
        })
        model({
                ka <- exp(tka + eta.ka)
                cl <- exp(tcl + eta.cl)
                v <- exp(tv + eta.v)
                linCmt() ~ prop(prop.sd)
        })
}
fit <- nlmixr(one.cmt, theo_sd, list(print=5), est=""saem"")

The first couple of iterations look like this: 
1:    0.1287   1.2322   3.6174   0.5700   0.2850   0.0950      inf
5:    0.1287   1.2322   3.6174   0.4643   0.2321   0.0774      nan
10:    0.1287   1.2322   3.6174   0.3618   0.1796   0.0602      nan

Interestingly, the proportional error works fine with focei (at least for theo_sd, but my data is more complex). The additive error seems to be ok. When I tried using a combined error, it converged, and the parameters were more or less similar to the ones obtained in Monolix. However, when I observed gradients, I noticed that the proportional error estimates are updated last. This is the output from theo_sd with 1cmt model and the combined error:

1:   -0.1035   1.2020   3.5329   0.5700   0.2850   0.1008   8.7751   1.0000
5:   -0.2479   1.9252   3.8812   0.6075   0.2904   0.0821   4.6754   1.0000
10:   -0.0070   1.9399   3.8867   0.4998   0.2247   0.0957   1.5933   1.4400
15:   -0.2010   1.9586   4.1084   0.4667   0.1871   0.0984   0.7435   1.6900
20:   -0.1121   1.8804   4.1319   0.3718   0.1447   0.0761   0.5811   1.6900

Is it ok, or are there some problems with the proportional error & saem in the combined model too?

I have some troubles with interpreting the values of residual error returned by nlmixR. According to the RxODE documentation, the combined1 and combined2 error models are as follows: 
combined1: transform(y)=transform(f)+(a+b*f^c)*eps
combined2: transform(y)=transform(f)+(a^2+b^2*f^(2c))*eps
However, in the Monolix documentation, the same errors are presented without transformation:
combined1: Concentration = Cc + (a + b*Cc) * e
combined2: Concentration = Cc + sqrt(a^2 + (b*Cc)^2) * e

Does it mean that nlmixR/RxODE log-transforms F? I assume that in nlmixR, a and b are constants, and eps follows a typical distribution with mean 0 and sd = 1. Or is it fixed to 1, while the residual error elements have mean = 0 and sd = a or b?

Also, I've found information that back-transformed parameters are converted to %CV. Is it still correct? Sorry to bother you, but I am confused.

I am going through this example of an AE table using the CDISC adsl and adae data.

I would prefer to have more direct and rigid mechanisms for creating specific classes (pkg_source(""<source directory>""), pkg_remote(""<remote url>"")) and then move the current pkg_ref functionality into a convenience function whose name indicates that it is doing some type conversion (as_pkg_ref(""arbitrary character value"")), possibly with some arguments that can limit the scope of viable sources.

One thing that really irks me is that pkg_ref is not type-stable, returning either a pkg_ref or list_of_pkg_ref class object depending on the length of the input character vector. It would be nice to make this more stable as well, either always returning a list or breaking out the flavor that can accommodate a vector.

In the spirit of putting a design out there for critique, here are some ideas for some tighter constructors:

```
# rigid constructors always return a single pkg_ref subclass object
pkg_source(""file path"")
pkg_remote(""url"", base_url = ""optional base url"")
pkg_cran(""package name"") # wrapper around pkg_remote with base_url default
pkg_bioc(""package name"") # wrapper around pkg_remote with base_url default
pkg_install(""absolute or relative file path"", lib_loc = ""optional relative path origin"") 
```
```
# attempt to parse a character for the appropriate pkg_ref, similar to pkg_ref now
find_pkg_ref(""arbitrary string"") # or 
as_pkg_ref(""arbitrary string"")
```

```
# to concretely build a package cohort
src_paths <- c(""dev/pkg1"", ""dev/pkg2"")
lapply(src_paths, pkg_source) # note, will not be a ""list_of_pkg_ref"", but rather a ""list""
```

```
# finally, as we're starting to think about cohorts more, I might suggest
pkg_library(""library location"") # returns a pkg_cohort object. in this case, a list of pkg_install 
pkg_cohort() # no arguments, just instantiates a structure around an empty list
as_pkg_cohort([list of pkg refs])

"nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr","Issues in saem as well as using CENS and LIMIT in the 2.0.3 version of nlmixr","https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/499","closed",2021-04-12,2021-04-19,2021-04-19,21,"Hi@mattfidler

I have recently noticed the usage of CENS and LIMIT in dataset as discribed in https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/RxODE/articles/RxODE-datasets.html. 

So I reinstalled nlmixr and RxODE to the latest version and modified my dataset to incorporate those BQL sample. For those, the DV is set to the LLOQ (400 ng/mL, 400 in dataset), and the corresponding MDV to 0, CENT to 1 and LIMIT to 0. For others, CENT and LIMIT are set to 0.

However, the model cannot work out with such messages:

focei: 
Error in .fitFun(.ret) : Evaluation error: infinite while evaluating initial objective function;
unhandled error message: EE:[lsoda] 500000 steps taken before reaching tout @(lsoda.c:748)
unhandled error message: EE:lsoda -- at t = 0 and step size _C(h) = 3.79444e-008, the corrector convergence failed repeatedly or
with fabs(_C(h)) = hmin;

saem: 
NaN in prediction; Consider: relax atol & rtol; change initials; change seed; change structure model;
unhandled error message: EE:[lsoda] 100000 steps taken before reaching tout@(lsoda.c:748)

At first I thought it was due to inappropriate initial value or model structure. However, after I deleted CENS and LIMIT column in my dataset, the focei running recovered as previously done, but saem still failed, even without CENS and LIMIT.

Then, I went back to the released nlmixr version 1.1.1.9, which requires reticulate/SnakecharmR to connect to python. To my surprise, both saem and fecei worked even using dataset with CENS and LIMIT column, although the OFV value seemed bigger compared those with same model but no CENS and LIMIT column in dataset, and in saem it tells:

DLSODA-  Warning..Internal T (=R1) and H (=R2) are such that in the machine, T + H = T on the next step  (H = step size). Solver will continue anyway.

So I suppose is there anything wrong in incorporation of the BQL data in the latest version of nlmixr. Or, there is something different with the new version 2.0.3. Have you got any idea about this?","diabloyg",7,0

This seems unusual because the same residual error model had worked in a previous version of the model (that was less complex in the math for one of the compartments, but was otherwise the same).  In the dataset, `CMT` and `DVID` are both used.  CMT includes values like `""SC""`, `""CENTRAL""`, and `""TG""`; while DVID is `NA_character_` for `CMT=""SC""` and `""cp""` for `CMT=""CENTRAL""` and `""TG""` for `CMT=""TG""`.

In this case displaying it in the table doesn't make sense, but also pruning or trimming the rtable is not an option as it will remove sections with zeroes that are meaningful as well. It would be helpful to have a customized way to subset rtable objects to be able to address the questions from the stakeholders in the best way, since not everything can be handled via layout. For this example the way to subset would be to create a dataframe with PARAMCDs and abnormality directions that make sense and then use it to compare with the content of rtable.
I have included an example where for ALT low abnormality direction is not ""possible"".

When simulating from that model, I do not know how to extract the simulation results with residual variable uncertainty.  Specifically, there is a `sim` column in the output, but it is not clear which endpoint that represents.

Unless I'm missing something, I think that the ask here is create the output columns differently.  Using the multiple endpoint model example from the vignette, I think that it would be preferable to remove the `sim` and `ipred` columns and add new columns named something like `sim_cp`, `sim_effect`, `ipred_cp` and `ipred_effect`.  In that example, the right-hand-size of the column name would come from the left-hand-side of the `~` defining the error model.

"nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr","Question: Can nlmixr fit a simple Emax model?","https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/517","open",2021-04-27,2021-07-29,NA,12,"I was trying to fit a relatively simple Emax model today which doesn't have any need for time or other parts.  (That is where some of the other issues I just reported are coming up...)

When doing so, I needed to have the model have a compartment (that seems reasonable), but it also appears to need `time` which does not seem so reasonable.  I do realize that nlmixr/RxODE has its origins in integrating ODEs, but it seems like removing the requirement of a `time` column when nothing really needs to be integrated would be helpful.  I would assume that time is not required when there are no ODEs defined by `d/dt` and there are no uses of `linCmt()`.

(Note that for the model below, the only reason I added the `d/dt()` was to define the compartment.)

The goal is to fit a simple individual PK model with SPECIE as a discreate covariate for Cl. Following discussion in 474 (https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/474) I set up it the following way:
ini({
    tClrat   <- log(3)
    tCldog <- log(1)

model({
 if ( SPECIE == 'Rat'){ ## SPECIE is a column in the data table

    if ( SPECIE == 'Dog'){

...  
})
No random effects were defined and focei, as suggest in discusion 409 (https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/409) was chosen as algorithm. This crashed R w/o any error message after. The last output in console:

Than I tried to introduce a dummy random effect ( eta.Vc ~ fix(0.0001) ) and use SAEM algorithm. In this case I got the following error message:

It would require modification to make it fit with `nlmixr` coding styles and to add tests.  Limitations of the current code are that it doesn't work if there is model nonconvergence (well, I'm pretty sure that what would happen is that it would stop looking in the region of nonconvergence, but that could yield loss of an answer in some cases) and that it only works on one parameter at a time (though expanding to multiple parameters would be pretty trivial, and that could be done before the PR).

I would assume that the only external function would be the method for the `profile()` generic.

I was experimenting with automating model selection process and run into trouble with this functionality. I was trying to add an additional if/else statement into the model (related to https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/521). 
Below is an example:

```r
## base model
m2c_ifelse1 <- function() {
  ini({
    tVc    <- log(0.3)
    tVp    <- log(0.3)
    tCl1   <- log(0.75)
    tClD   <- log(1)
    prop.err <- 0.05
  })
  model({
    Vc  = exp(tVc )  
    Vp  = exp(tVp)
    
    if ( SPECIEN == 1){
      Cl  = exp(tCl1) 
    }
    ClD = exp(tClD)
    
    d/dt(center) = - Cl / Vc * center - ClD / Vc * center + ClD / Vp * periph 
    d/dt(periph) =                      ClD / Vc * center - ClD / Vp * periph
    cp = center / Vc
    cp ~ prop(prop.err)
  })
}

## an attempt to update a model code with an additional if/else statement
m2c_ifelse1upd <- nlmixr(m2c_ifelse1) %>% 
  model( { if ( SPECIEN == 2){ Cl  = exp(tCl2) }}) %>%
  ini(   tCl2   = log(1.5))

## issue 
my expectation was that additional parameter tCl2 will be added to the ini block and that the second if/else statement will be added to the model:
```r
    if ( SPECIEN == 1){
        Cl = exp(tCl1)
    }
    if ( SPECIEN == 2){
        Cl = exp(tCl2)
    }

````
 
However that is not the outcome. Am I using this change model syntax is incorrectly or do I have wrong expectations about this functionality?

"Roche/rtables","New split function - a multidimensional generalization of current split family functions","https://github.com/Roche/rtables/issues/203","closed",2021-05-12,2021-08-19,2021-08-19,17,"Hi @gmbecker ( @danielinteractive - FYI )

The issue I am raising here is quite similar to recent #109 (`trim_levels_by_map`), but it is more generic.

Sometimes, when splitting rows with `split_rows_by` based on a certain variable, we may want to keep/drop/remove the levels of not only the split variable, but also the levels of other variables in data split. As an example for 'keep' scenario; consider a simple data set defined below
```
> d <- data.frame(V1 = factor(rep(c(""V1L1"", ""V1L2""), each = 2), levels = c(""V1L1"", ""V1L2"")),
                  V2 = factor(c(""V2L1"", ""V2L2"", ""V2L3"", ""V2L4""), levels = c(""V2L1"", ""V2L2"", ""V2L3"", ""V2L4"")))
> d
#     V1   V2
# 1 V1L1 V2L1
# 2 V1L1 V2L2
# 3 V1L2 V2L3
# 4 V1L2 V2L4
```
Lets say I split rows of `d` with `split_rows_by(V1)`. Now, after the split I would like to keep the following levels **only**
 - `V1L1` for `V1` and `V2L1`, `V2L2` for `V2` for the first data split (rows 1-2)
 - `V1L2` for `V1` and `V2L3`, `V2L4` for `V2` for the second data split (rows 3-4).

Similar examples can be constructed for drop/remove scenarios. So this is a kind of multidimensional generalization of current split functions for variables other than just split variable.

I wrote this below function for the 'keep' scenario, as an example. It is far from perfect but works well for at least some basics scenarios I was able to create.

```
# Custom split function to use with split_rows_by. 
# It is a generalization of rtables::keep_split_levels.
# It not only keeps a specific levels of splitting variable but also 
# allows to keep levels of other variables after the split, 
# conditionally on the level of the split variable, as specified by map
keep_split_levels_of_vars <- function(map = NULL) {
  
  if (is.null(map))
    stop(""No map dataframe was provided."")
  
  myfun <- function(df, spl, vals = NULL, labels = NULL, trim = FALSE) {
    
    splvar <- rtables:::spl_payload(spl)
    spllev <- df[[splvar]]
    spllevkeep <- as.character(na.omit(unique(map[[splvar]]))) # levels of split variable to keep 
    
    if (is.factor(spllev) && !all(spllevkeep %in% levels(spllev))) 
      stop(""Attempted to keep invalid factor level(s) in split "", setdiff(spllevkeep, levels(spllev)))
    
    df2 <- df[spllev %in% spllevkeep, ]
    rtables:::spl_child_order(spl) <- spllevkeep
    
    ret <- rtables:::.apply_split_inner(spl, df2, vals = spllevkeep, labels = labels, trim = trim)
    
    # keep non-split variables levels
    vars <- setdiff(colnames(map), splvar)  # variable names except split variable
    ret$datasplit <- lapply(ret$values, function(l) {
      
      df3 <- ret$datasplit[[l]]
      
      for (v in vars) {
        lev <- df3[[v]]
        levkeep <- as.character(na.omit(unique(map[map[, splvar] == l, v])))
        if (is.factor(lev) && !all(levkeep %in% levels(lev))) 
          stop(""Attempted to keep invalid factor level(s) in split "", setdiff(levkeep, levels(lev)))
        
        df3 <- df3[lev %in% levkeep, , drop = FALSE]
        
        if (is.factor(lev))
          df3[[v]] <- factor(as.character(df3[[v]]), levels = levkeep)
      }
      
      df3
    })
    names(ret$datasplit) <- ret$values
    ret
  }
  
  myfun
}
```

I would be thankful, if you could share your thoughts on this idea, especially in case we could achieve the same results with some existing `rtables` functionality? or if not - how feasible would be to add this functionality into `rtables`. 

Thank you.

Add boilerplate governance standards for folks who want to contribute to the project. 

Features included:

1. Bug and Feature Request templates when creating new issues. 
2. Code Owners who will be automatically added as reviewers when a new PR is created. This provides us with the ability to merge PRs _only_ after the PR has been approved by one or more code owners. 
3. Basic contribution guidelines.
4. A simple PR template to allow contributors to make sure that they are abiding by the governance standards set herein.

may I ask you how did you implement the communication between FE and BE after having triggered time-consuming operations such as model training (which run in separated threads)? How does the BE inform FE (for rerendering entire information on the page) after finishing a time-consuming job? 

At the first glance, I could see that you don't use sockets.

I was trying to fit a dual absorption model using the dataset that shows dual absorption.
I have tried:
1. Zero-order absorption followed by the first-order absorption 
2. First-order absorption followed by zero-order absorption

The first model (Zero + first) seems to work fine, but somehow, the second model does not recognize parameter ALAG2 
So, I also made another dataset that includes both ALAG1 and ALAG2 and fitted to the first model (Zero+first) and it seems to estimate the ALAG2 parameter. 

I have been stuck with this problem forever. Would be so appreciated if I could get some help, please. 
I have attached the dataset as well.

I am working with version 1.1.1-5 on R 3.6.3. I appreciate that a lot of work has gone into the package since then but do not have the option of updating.
 
After a seemingly successful installation of **nlmixr**  and dependencies`library(nlmixr)` is giving me the following error:

My feeling is that the cause is a non-R dependency problem but this error isn't giving me anything useful to diagnose the problem. I was wondering if you've seen this error before and can suggest anything that might be causing the problem? If it's relevant, `library(RxODE)` runs successfully.

The OS is redhat 7.7 eus repos. I have successfully used the same version of the package on other servers with the same OS, R packages, system dependencies and install process but it's failing on a new server. 

Any pointers would be much appreciated! I'll try to provide any additional information that you think may help you diagnose the problem. Thanks in advance.","erp31",22,0

"atorus-research/xportr","Proposed feature: abbreviate variable names <= 8 chars","https://github.com/atorus-research/xportr/issues/1","open",2021-06-15,2021-06-15,NA,0,"Greetings, thanks for sharing your work with the greater pharma industry! Maybe I can help contribute: I've done some work on prepping [sas v5 transport files](https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/9.4_3.5/movefile/n1xbwdre0giahfn11c99yjkpi2yb.htm) in my current role with Biogen. Specifically, via a pkg & shiny app that automatically abbreviates variables names <= 8.

To augment the package beyond just checking for <=8 chars, I'd be willing to contribute function called `xportr_var_rename()` or something similar that takes the `var_spec` object and performs an abbreviation algorithm, where each variable would be renamed using the least intrusive method possible (to maintain originality) to achieve <=8 chars. If you think it's within scope of the `xportr` package, please let me know!

Here's an example of my function as it works today, using some clinical variable names and again, using randomly generated sentences:

Could we track the 'trust worthiness' of the package as a badge? e.g.  calculate risk metric score and show it as a badge? 

## Steps

Add riskmetric to cicd - and expose as badge (if no badge service exists I guess could just write a svg via the gh action).

## Concern

Is the score designed to be used on a single package? e.g. what does '0.8' mean to an end user?

It's also easy for us to game the number by looking at the categories - although maybe that also increases the quality of the package so is ok?

Identify:
--> issues for company specific functionality 
--> issues for admiral core specific functionality 

Potential functionality:

- Automatically select all predecessor variables from source dataset(s)
- read in parameters

Final Step
- Drop all variables in dataset which are not listed in spec (or output a WARNING?)
- Highlight varaibles in spec but not in dataset?
- Check actual variable type against type specified in spec
- Apply labels from spec to dataset (would this include SDTM vars?)
- Apply formats from spec to dataset (date/datetime formats only)
- Cross-check values of variables against controlled terminology in spec
- Apply length to variables when exporting (already covered in {xport}?)
- Automatically sort by keys provided in spec
- Derive a decode or code variable based on controlled terminology (e.g. you have SEX=M or F and then based on CT you can derived SEXN as 1 or 2 from a CT list)
- Sort variables within datasets as defined in the spec (column order)

Notice that the cells in the first row of `result` span two cells of other columns. Meanwhile, rtables::as_html returns an HTML table, in which the first row spans double the number of other rows. In essence, I would expect a result to be this:

The preliminary approach was to first do popPK modeling, then have individual exposure prediction, and finally link individual exposure to adverse events using logistic regression or survival analysis. However, such approach disconnected PK and PD, and if logistic regression is used the time information of events is ignored.

Then I would like to try joint PK-PD model which incorporating individual predicted PK parameters and observed PD events with time record, which is PK-categorical PD model. As far as I know the ensence of such approach is to redefine the likelihood function as those in NONMEM. However, I have no idea whether it could be resolved in nlmixr. If it is allowed, could you please tell me how to handle this?","diabloyg",4,0

"nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr","Development Idea: Library of model snippets and model expansion","https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/541","open",2021-07-02,2021-07-02,NA,0,"Somewhat related to #540

To be very clear from the outset, I think that this would likely reside in another package than nlmixr, but it would be very tightly related.  One common naming syntax for packages like this is something like `nlmixrExtra`.

My thought here is something like an `nlmixr_tran()` function that would perform pre-processing of models to expand commonly-used model structures.

```r
library(nlmixrExtra)
onecmt <- function() {
  ini({
    lCl <- 1.6
    lVc <- log(18)
    lVmax <- log(0.1)
    lC50 <- log(100)
    eta_Cl ~ 0.1
    prop_err <- c(0, 0.2, 1)
  })
  model({
    Cl <- exp(lCl + eta_Cl)
    Vc <- exp(lVc)
    Vmax <- exp(lVmax)
    mm_c50 <- exp(lC50)
    cp <- TMDD_Michaelis_Menten(CL=Cl, Vc=Vc, Vmax=Vmax, C50=mm_c50, compartment=central)
    cp ~ prop(prop_err)
  })
}
onecmt_expanded <- nlmixr_tran(onecmt)
```

`nlmixr_tran()` would modify the model and return that modified model (or perhaps go ahead and call nlmixr with that modified model if `estimate=TRUE` or something like that).

The output of `onecmt_expanded` would expand out the `linear_pk()` function to look like:

```r
function() {
  ini({
    lCl <- 1.6
    lVc <- log(18)
    lVmax <- log(0.1)
    lC50 <- log(100)
    eta_Cl ~ 0.1
    prop_err <- c(0, 0.2, 1)
  })
  model({
    Cl <- exp(lCl + eta_Cl)
    Vc <- exp(lVc)
    Vmax <- exp(lVmax)
    mm_c50 <- exp(lC50)
    d/dt(central) = -central*Cl/Vc - central*Vmax/(central/Vc + mm_c50)
    cp <- central/Vc
    cp ~ prop(prop_err)
  })
}
```

With an expansion mechanism (as suggested with `nlmixr_trans()`), it would be comparatively straight-forward to make the substitution functions like `TMDD_Michaelis_Menten()`.","billdenney",0,0
"nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr","Feature Request: linCmt() on the right hand side with less automation","https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/540","open",2021-07-02,2021-07-02,NA,0,"I have a model where I want to simultaneously use two `linCmt()` PK models while fitting the PD model.  But, I think that `linCmt()` is only valid on the left hand side of an error model assignment (i.e. `linCmt() ~ prop(prop.err)`).

The feature request here has a few different parts to attempt to have the goal of using it for different drugs in the same model.

1. Can `linCmt()` go on the right hand side of an assignment statement (e.g. `cp = linCmt()`)?  Maybe it already can, but I have not seen documentation of an example of that.
2. Can a new version of linCmt be made where it can accept named arguments rather than auto-detecting the parameters?  The goal of this part is that you could work with more than one drug at a time.  (This is a bit different than using DVID or some other method like that because of the idea that I may want to work with more than one `linCmt()` drug at the same time.  If I need to do a calculation like `cp_drug1 = linCmt([parameters for drug 1])`, `cp_drug2 = linCmt([parameters for drug 2])`, and then some calculation with `cp_drug1` and `cp_drug2` such as a competitive Emax model, I can't immediately think of a way to do that.)

An example of what I'd like to be able to do is below.

```r
library(nlmixr)
double_onecmt <- function() {
  ini({
    lCl1 <- 1.6      ; label(""Cl drug 1 (L/hr)"")

With tibble 3.1.0 even `my_tibble[FALSE, ""notAColumn""] <- 1` will result in a new column being created. This is [intended behavior](https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble/issues/846) for tibble now. This breaks `fill_missing_data()` which is an unexported function in read_hf.R. This is the offending line:
```
 .data[is.na(.data[var]), var] <- correct_defaults(var)
```
`correct_defaults` returns NULL when var is 'type'. This would never happen in an actual hf_file but even if it returns null, tibble is trying to add a new column and failing because its not a vector, a bare list, a data frame or a matrix.

Thankfully this is an easy fix. Either add type as a option in the `correct_defaults` as a blank matrix, or add an if statement like the following:
```
if(any(is.na(.data[[var]]))
          .data[is.na(.data[[var]]), var] <- correct_defaults(var)","elimillera",2,2

As described in `?pkg_ref`, we expect that `pkg_remote` is a superclass of `pkg_cran_remote`, `pkg_bioc_remote` and `pkg_git_remote`. 

Because of this, many metrics for cran and biocondcutor remotes fail to inherit generic metrics implemented for `pkg_remote`s.","dgkf",1,0

I added in a programmatically accessible class hierarchy (nested list) which is traversed in search of valid `source` classes, and applies the entire class hierarchy to the resulting object. eg

```r
class(pkg_ref(""mypkg"", source = ""pkg_cran_remote""))
#> c(""pkg_cran_remote"", ""pkg_remote"", ""pkg_ref"", ""environment"")

class(pkg_ref(""mypkg"", source = ""pkg_install""))

Only concern I have with this approach is allowing users to extend with their own subclasses, but we can cross that bridge when we get there. I don't see any demand for that functionality quite yet. 

@elimillera - would you mind taking a look since most of the changes affect code that was introduced in #203?

* The use of `case_when` function: `!is.na` in the first case in the example below is irrelevant, it either needs to be used explicitly everywhere, or nowhere, or as a single clause:
  ```
  format_agegr1 <- function(x) {
    case_when(
      !is.na(x) & x < 18 ~ ""< 18"",
      x >= 18 & x < 65 ~ ""18 - 65"",
      x >= 65 ~ "">= 65""
    )
  }
  ```

  The two calls have the same result: 
  ```
  format_agegr2 <- function(x) {
    case_when(
      x < 18 ~ ""< 18"",  
      x >= 18 & x < 65 ~ ""18 - 65"",

    )
  }
  format_agegr1(c(NA,10,20))
  format_agegr2(c(NA,10,20))
  ```
  See the examples of `?case_when` for further details. There are multiple cases of this throughout the package.

* We now have templates (inst/templates) and example scripts (inst/example_scripts). The difference between those two is minor so I would suggest to use templates instead of example scripts everywhere. Anyway, the example scripts are only used as a reference in vignettes and in data:

"pharmaR/riskmetric","How to integrate metrics from other packages?","https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric/issues/209","open",2021-07-13,2021-07-13,NA,0,"As the audience of `riskmetric` grows, we're seeing new packages that offer really compelling metrics, but might introduce new dependencies, drastically increase runtime or only apply in niche applications. One of our design goals has always been extensibility, yet we don't have any concrete examples of how a package might extend riskmetric. 

I've added the [Package Integration](https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric/labels/Package%20Integration) label to track our backlog specific to packages which may want to register metrics with `riskmetric`. 

## Design

### Option 1: All metrics created in `riskmetric`

Perhaps the most straightforward solution is just to implement metrics within `riskmetric`. However, this would bloat our dependency footprint and runtimes meaning that we may want to build more interfaces to restricting which sets of metrics get run. 

### Option 2: All metrics created in `riskmetric`, but only run if `Suggests` dependency is installed

As a way of mitigating this management, perhaps we could only turn on these behaviors when those dependencies are available. However, this feels like an enormous amount of dependency management, which really should be handled by the package installation instead.

### Option 3: Offshoot packages (eg, `riskmetric.<use case>`)

Alternatively, we could develop more focused packages - perhaps by theme such as `riskmetric.security`, or by package that is integrated such as `riskmetric.srr`or `riskmetric.autotest`. This would let us fragment metrics among a few different extension packages so that specific metric classes or packages handle all the bookkeeping for their own dependencies.

### Option 4: Encourage packages to refer to `riskmetric` via `Enhances`

I think the devil might be in the details with this one, but we could aim to make it as easy as possible for other packages to register metrics that enhance `riskmetric` - possibly without even taking on a direct dependency since all of our extensions operate through S3 dispatch. I think this could be the most comfortable way to encourage extensions and we could rely on a canonical way of tracking enhancement via the DESCRIPTION `Enhances` field. I think a proof-of-concept would be needed to make sure this is feasible before encouraging this path forward, though. 

### Option ... ? 

Open to suggestions.

## Action Items

Whatever path we take, I think we could use a new vignette showing how to integrate new metrics that bring niche or intensive metrics to `riskmetric`.

"Roche/rtables","Deprecate insert_rrow support for TableTree objects?","https://github.com/Roche/rtables/issues/214","closed",2021-07-14,2021-09-30,2021-09-30,4,"When analyzing the behavior in #202 a number of problematic corner cases for `insert_rrow` in non-trivial tables occurred to me. While we can easily continue to support `insert_rrow` for `ElementaryTable` objects, its not clear we can in the general case in a way that is both coherent and likely to be useful rather than confusing to the user.

# Ambiguities

## LabelRow in position that does not correspond to a substructure

Currently this works, and a labelrow is placed whre a DataRow would have been, but I am fairly confident this is ultimately a broken table structure. Even if it is not, it is will make retrieving the cell values of the table or subtable not have the expected dimensions.

## LabelRow in a position where multiple subtables with non-visible label rows are present between two visible rows.

This is ambiguous. We could choose to always do minimum depth or always maximum depth from amongst the options, but those will have very different resulting indentation structures and its not clear one or the other is always what the user will want.

## Label row at a position where a visible label row already exists in the structure

I don't think it should replace the existing label, as this is an insert operation, but if we put it in as a normal child we have the same issues we did above. 

## DataRow in position that spans structural breaks

This is supported now, and is ""greedy"", ie it will always be the last sibling of the previous row rather than the first sibling of the trailing row corresponding to the position. This is ""correct"" in that it avoids issues where the trailing row is a label, and thus cannot have a preceeding direct sibling that is a Data row, but it is also not unambiguously what the user is going to want.

There may be others.

It's not exactly clear to me how the output columns are calculated in censored results.  Is this documented somewhere, and is there a better way to calculate them?

What I think I'm seeing based on the outputs in my model are:

* DV: cumulative distribution function value at IPRED
* IPRED: value of the measurement (estimated actual value, not probability density estimate)
* IRES: DV - IPRED
* IWRES: IRES/[residual error model standard deviation]

I would have thought that the following would be the column outputs

* DV: simply copying over the DV from the input dataset
* IPRED: cumulative distribution function since it is a censored row
* IRES and IWRES would likely be missing since given the above two, DV and IPRED would not be comparable","billdenney",1,0

Thanks for your package.

While using the package I noticed the function `plot.dyn.ID` does not seem to plot anything and produces the error: `Error in for (s in m) {: invalid for() loop sequence`.
I created the `dyn.ID` object using the example code from the `dynmodel` help file.
An error for a missing environment was also displayed even though the argument `evTable` is no longer listed in the help for the function `plot.dyn.ID`. Hence the argument was included in the example below.

"Roche/rtables","rtables - cell numerical (fraction) output alignment","https://github.com/Roche/rtables/issues/218","open",2021-07-19,2021-07-19,NA,2,"Hi @gmbecker, @anajens 

How feasible would be to improve numerical output alignment in a cell? For example

```
df <- data.frame(
  USUBJID = as.character(c(1:15, 1)),
  ARM = factor(c(""A"", ""B"", ""B"", ""A"", ""A"", ""A"", ""B"", ""A"", ""B"", ""B"", ""B"", ""B"", ""B"", ""B"", ""B"", ""B""), 
               levels = c(""A"", ""B"")),
  AETOXGR = factor(c(1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4), levels = c(1:5)),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by(""ARM"") %>%
  summarize_occurrences_by_grade(var = ""AETOXGR"") %>%
  build_table(df)

       A          B    
-----------------------
1   2 (40%)   1 (9.1%) 
2      0      2 (18.2%)
3   1 (20%)       0    
4   1 (20%)   8 (72.7%)
5   1 (20%)       0  
```

It think this below formatting would be more nicer (note the alignment to the . for the percentage:

```
       A          B    
-----------------------
1   2 (40%)   1 ( 9.1%) 
2   0         2 (18.2%)
3   1 (20%)   0    
4   1 (20%)   8 (72.7%)
5   1 (20%)   0  
```

In other words, the numbers should be aligned according to their significance digits, i.e.
```
120
 22
 30
```

Potential discussion topics:
- How to better align the app with the package?
- There are many features that can be added to the app, but among those, which one would be beneficial for current or even future features of `riskmetric`?
- How to increase visibility of the app?

6: In (function (uif, data, est = NULL, control = list(), ..., sum.prod = FALSE,  :

I didn't see which parameter appeared to be near its boundary, so I assume that it is one of the fixed parameters (see the model in #548 and the request in #544).

I have prepared SAS code using PROC NLMIXED for Emax and ED50 and results are matching with phoenix NMLE -Emax modeling.

Now I wanted to develop the code with r using nlmixr and need help from the experts.
Below is model text for NLME

While writing tests for it, I could never cover or trigger a certain part of the function. Generally, parts of the function don't seem very robust. I assume there is a functional bug and not all lines are actually used to achieve what it currently does.

1) The function obviously works
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12818242/127642358-2d67787a-cf1f-4bd3-b36a-49aa62dd63dc.png)

2) Lines 52-55 seem to be untriggerable?
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12818242/127642444-1dc2d591-7b79-40d7-8bcf-4010ca21b278.png)

Based on my testing it seems that lines 36-38 and 44-47 do what they're supposed to. That way, 49-58 defaults to x, never jumping into the if-condition. In my tests, `legends.widths` only ever returned `NULL`, even when properly aligning the widths. Therefore, `max.legends.width` defaults to `-Inf`. It seems this behaviour doesn't keep the code from working though. 

Also, the function could be written in a more maintenance-friendly way, e.g. [line 38](https://github.com/openpharma/visR/blob/a8e790e29fc6f2448bc7daed955c6de63a2805cd/R/utils_visr.R#L54).","timtreis",76,0

I have just downloaded and run the following docker image: ghcr.io/insightsengineering/rstudio_4.1.0_bioc_3.13:latest
I unfortunately realised that it does not contain all the NEST R libraries, and I would have to install them manually. 
This is quite inefficient; with the old rocker images - all the NEST packages were available which was very convenient. 
Can you pl. include all the NEST R libraries into this new docker image?

The second question within this issue is, as long as we do not have NEST libs preinstalled in the image - what is the right and proper way of installing it?

There is now an S3 object `dependency_structure` created using function `dependency_table` (see the function doc for more information) which can be used as below. There have also been simplifications to the structure of the code base

- Using the `project_type` argument you can create a `dependency_structure` from a remote repo rather than checking it out first and passing in a directory.

```
# create dependency_structure object from a checked out repo...
x <- dependency_table(project = ""../stageddeps.electricity"", verbose = 1)
# ... or directly from a remote

"Roche/rtables","trim_levels_to_map vs trim_levels_in_group","https://github.com/Roche/rtables/issues/236","closed",2021-08-23,2021-08-27,2021-08-27,3,"Hi @gmbecker, 

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the relationship between `trim_levels_to_map` vs `trim_levels_in_group`. 

Is the plan to retire `trim_levels_in_group` altogether? 

If not, then I think `trim_levels_in_group` could be useful in simple cases where the user wants to control levels of a variable passed down to `analyze` but without specifying a map. I'm thinking `trim_levels_in_group` could be a type of ""super drop_split_levels"" function similar to `drop_and_remove_levels`. The limitation right now is that it just controls `innervar` levels and not the levels of the split variable itself which I think would be common.

Here's an example use case: If I want to achieve the layout below...

```
      all obs
-------------
A            
  a      1   
B            
  b      1   
C            
  c      1  
```

... I can use these layouts:
```r
dat1 <- data.frame(
  l1 = factor(c(""A"", ""B"", ""C""), levels = c(""A"", ""B"", ""C"")), # note that level X is not included
  l2 = factor(c(""a"", ""b"", ""c""), levels = c(""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""x""))
)

# This works
basic_table() %>%
  split_rows_by(""l1"", split_fun = trim_levels_in_group(""l2"")) %>%
  analyze(""l2"") %>%
  build_table(dat1)

dat2 <- data.frame(
  l1 = factor(c(""A"", ""B"", ""C""), levels = c(""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""X"")), # here we add X to ""l1""
  l2 = factor(c(""a"", ""b"", ""c""), levels = c(""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""x""))
)

# This gives an error because trim_levels_in_group does not drop the empty ""l1"" levels
basic_table() %>%
  split_rows_by(""l1"", split_fun = trim_levels_in_group(""l2"")) %>%
  analyze(""l2"") %>%
  build_table(dat2)

map <- data.frame(lapply(dat2, as.character), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# This works nicely but user needs to do the extra step and provide a map

This is a very rough draft, but I am hoping it will seed a number of discussions on how we implement a cohort class, how we dispatch methods to it, what a cohort metric is and is not.

To do: 
1. More robust cohort_ref constructors
  1. should be able to handle different types of libraries (installed, remote, etc)
  2. should make assessment of the cohort against the library easy to implement (right now it is a bit convoluted and ugly)
  3. Maybe add a meta/aggregate ref slot for the library
2. Better defintions of what goes into the `ref` object vs `assessment` object
3. A more formal cohort assessment class structure; currently just using a list
4. methods to handle the case where library is `NULL` to do a cohort comparison against itself.

I am thinking perhaps for all dates that are passed in to be used in manipulations (exclude where they are sorts and things like that) we have a function or rule to `lubridate::force_tz(date, tz = ""UTC"")`.  We are assigning a timezone in `impute_dtc` as ""UTC"" and that may be the start of everything getting a bit our of sync, those dates are interacting with dates passed in.  We may want to revisit this again.

I checked in our WARP again and with the update to the test scripts, it seems to be working.

Should be platform independent (or if not possible then should handle gracefully) 

What happens if you don't have permission to install the dependencies? etc

Should we actually install or should we have a function `get_external_dependencies(dep_structure, <<args>>)`
and then it is user's responsibility to actually install them? e.g. in an automation pipeline have:

```
x <- dependency_table(...)
external_deps <- get_external_dependencies(x, ...)
if (length(external_deps) > 0) {
  # run external_deps installation command
)
install_deps(x, ...) # install R packages

This would be a much cleaner solution rather than as a side effect of running install_deps having lots of system deps installed
but may not be as easy to use or implement...

    LOW         1   
    HIGH        1   

```
I think, that it should be partially handled with the analysis function (with e.g. `drop` logical parametr). 
The question is then, what should analysis function return so that the rtables routines can understand it is as ""do not print""?
Note that for a couple of good reasons we do not want to modify the `map` itself just to handle this ""0"" record case.

Thank you

"openpharma/visR","`visR::add_risktable()` fails with a cryptic error message when the `strata` variable contains missing values.","https://github.com/openpharma/visR/issues/261","closed",2021-09-14,2021-10-14,2021-10-14,3,"#### Issue description

When generating a Kaplan-Meier plot with a stratifying variable, `visR::add_risktable()` fails with a rather cryptic error message. If one does not include the risk table, the plot is generated without problems. It is only the creating of the risk table that produces the error, as illustrated in the example below

#### Steps to reproduce the issue

Please share code if possible.

```r
library(visR)
set.seed(42)

# Dataset without missing values
dataset <- data.frame(
  AVAL = rexp(n = 30, rate = 10),
  CNSR = sample(c(0, 1), size = 30, replace = TRUE),
  strata = gl(n = 2, k = 15, labels = c(""A"", ""B""))
)

# Dataset with missing values
dataset_na <- dataset
is.na(dataset_na$strata[sample(seq_len(30), size = 5)]) <- TRUE

# Works
dataset %>%
  visR::estimate_KM(strata = ""strata"") %>%
  visR::visr(fun = ""surv"") %>%
  visR::add_risktable(label = c(""Subjects at Risk"", ""Censored""),
                      statlist = c(""n.risk"", ""n.censor""))

# Fails
dataset_na %>%
  visR::estimate_KM(strata = ""strata"") %>%
  visR::visr(fun = ""surv"") %>%
  visR::add_risktable(label = c(""Subjects at Risk"", ""Censored""),
                      statlist = c(""n.risk"", ""n.censor""))
```

#### What's the expected result?

We would expect the risk table to be added to the plot.


#### What's the actual result?

The following error message is produced:

```
Error: Tibble columns must have compatible sizes.
* Size 5: Column `na.action`.
* Size 25: Columns `time`, `n.risk`, `n.event`, `n.censor`, `surv`, and 9 more.
ℹ Only values of size one are recycled.
Run `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.
```

#### Additional details / screenshot

The issue is localised in the `tidyme.R` file, and more precisely starting from [this line](https://github.com/openpharma/visR/blob/a70cc2d775f7510dd1f03edf77cac2421943063a/R/tidyme.R#L66). The missing values cause the objects that should be bound together to have different lengths, and this is what seems to be igniting the issue.

I tried my best to keep minutes:

> Mark described an rOpenSci workflow that includes
>   - running pre-review checks
>   - adding a markdown-formatted report to the merge request comment thread including check results
> 
> On the decision to use an API service vs GitHub Action
>   - API is easier to debug locally
>   - An action is easier to manage environment (offload responsibility of system libraries to users of the Action)
>   - As discussed, the management of an environment would present a major challenge - GitHub Actions might be a better choice for our use case
>  
> On producing a badge
>   - rOpenSci has an example of how they manage this in [ropensci-org/badges](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_requests.html#get-single-mr)
>  - recommendation is to get the rest of the workflow working first, then add in a badge - but hosting a badge on a registry should be a last step in building out the service
> 
> On hosting a `riskmetric` reports portal
>   - rOpenSci has a clever process for submitting package-produced html pages to a repository whose github pages page collects and serves these pages as a report portal
>   - rOpenSci has an example of how [they serve `pkgstats` reports](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/roreviewapi/tree/gh-pages), with the code for managing deployment in [gh-pages.R](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/roreviewapi/blob/main/R/gh-pages.R)
>  - The action can share a link to this report (I missed noting down how this link is shared to a user) as a more user-friendly mechanism of sharing check results
>  - Mark walked us through how credentials are managed to allow individual package repositories to push new static pages into this pages-hosted webpage, but it went over my head. We have a lot of work to do until this is a necessary part of our process - we can revisit it when we're ready to start hosting pages.

As discussed during PSI2021, life tables might be a thing that we should implement. It seems like a fairly quick win and would be an additional feature integrating into the time-to-event-analysis theme.

**Do you have any examples you can share of what it looks like?**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_table

```
visR::adtte %>%
  visR::estimate_KM() %>%
  visR::get_risktable(statlist = c(""n.risk"", ""n.event"", ""n.censor"")) %>%
  tidyr::spread(y_values, Overall) %>%
  visR::render(title = ""Life table"", datasource = ""visR::adtte"")

**What potential packages/functions could be used to make this plot?**

Farily easy with `tidyr` and `visR`, merely a wrapper around a bunch of stuff that's already implemented. Would be nice to have some standard intervals on the left (regularily spaced, smart guessing?) but to also expose the option of custom intervals like

```
visR::adtte %>%
  visR::estimate_KM() %>%
  visR::lifetable(intervals = list(c(-Inf, 18), c(19-60), c(61, Inf)),
                  columns = c(""n.risk"", ""n.event"", ""n.censor"", ""survival"", ""CI_lower"", ""CI_upper""))

I have a moderate-complexity model that gets a ""subscript out of bounds"" error in `nlmixrUI.saem.model.omega()` due to the fact that `etd` goes up to 18 but `dm` is only 17.  So, the matrix dimension is not big enough for the etas (if I'm reading the code correctly).

The reason for splitting the table in two is because the layout must be able to display content rows with 0s which doesn't work because `analyze` must always return some content. As an alternative I would use dummy levels and then prune them away but was curious to hear your thoughts on whether the rbind approach is even feasible.

For example, for a responder analysis the analysis model might be a logistic regression for a dichotomized endpoint. One might additionally want the estimated proportion of responders in the two groups and not just the adjusted difference between them in log-odds scale, which is a regression coefficient in the logistic regression used to study significance but not easily interpretable.

This could be done by simply allowing the (user-defined) analysis model to return `se = NA` for the proportions parameters. The pooling function should simply in this case return `NA` for SE, CIs and p-value but still return the pooled point estimate.","nociale",33,2
"Novartis/xgxr","Feature Suggestion:  scale_x_VISITDY to implement skipping day 0","https://github.com/Novartis/xgxr/issues/49","open",2021-10-06,2021-10-06,NA,0,"For communication with the clinical teams, it is often useful to create figures using the CDISC representation of days where day 0 does not exist (the time scale goes from Day -1, 23 hours, 59 minutes to Day 1, 0 hours, 0 minutes).

I have created a set of functions to implement the `trans` for ggplot2 which represents VISITDY (or any --DY variable) where 0 does not exist (actually the way I coded it, 0 becomes -1).  I currently have the function in my semi-private Rsdtm library (i.e. it is public, but I don't advertise its existence), but I think it would be a better fit in xgxr.

What it does is:

* Fold Day 0 to Day -1 (making Day 0 an error is problematic due to the ways that I understand the transformation function is called),
* Never show fractional days,
* Prefer showing weeks (units of 7) when the axis range gets large,
* Always show Day -1 and Day 1 to make it clear that Day 0 was skipped on the axis (when the range of days gets very large, that could be a problem because the text ""-1"" and ""1"" would overlap), and
* Show every day for minor ticks (that could be improved when the number of minor ticks gets large).

If interested, I could make a PR to put it into xgxr.

I can also imagine a partner function named something like `as_VISITDY()` that would have an argument of `units` to convert continuous scale numbers to VISITDY numbers and then use that as input like `ggplot(my_data, aes(x=as_VISITDY(TSFD, units=""hours""), y=y)) +   Rsdtm::scale_x_VISITDY() + geom_point()`.

Here is an example of its use:

``` r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(x=-7:14, y=-7:14), aes(x=x, y=y, label=x)) +
  Rsdtm::scale_x_VISITDY() +
  geom_text()

"nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr","How to manually define exponential RUV and proportional RUV by norm() function?","https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/564","closed",2021-10-06,2021-10-07,2021-10-07,2,"Dear `nlmixr` team,

I found that additive RUV `cp ~ add(add.sd)` is equivalent to `cp ~ norm(add.sd)` in [userguide book](https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/nlmixr_bookdown/vignettes.html)!

How can I define in this way for proportional RUV, I tried `cp ~ norm(cp*prop.sd)` but it doesn't work, with error like that: `Error in nlmixrUIModel(.model, ini, fun) : residual distribution parameter(s) estimates were not found in ini block`. Code is:
```
one.compartment <- function() {
  ini({
    tka <- 0.45 # Log Ka
    tcl <- 1 # Log Cl
    tv <- 3.45    # Log V
    eta.ka ~ 0.6
    eta.cl ~ 0.3
    eta.v ~ 0.1
    prop.sd <- 0.7
  })
  model({
    ka <- exp(tka + eta.ka)
    cl <- exp(tcl + eta.cl)
    v <- exp(tv + eta.v)
    d/dt(depot) = -ka * depot
    d/dt(center) = ka * depot - cl / v * center
    cp = center / v
    cp ~ norm(cp*prop.sd)
  })
}

fit2 <- nlmixr(one.compartment, theo_sd, list(print=0), est=""focei"")
```
And, with exponential RUV, how can I define it in the model. Is that `log(cp) ~ norm(expo.sd)`?

Thank you for the explanation!

"insightsengineering/rbmi","Update pval calculation for bootstrap percentiles","https://github.com/insightsengineering/rbmi/issues/232","open",2021-10-07,2021-11-01,NA,0,"I spent some time thinking about how we invert the bootstrap percentile CI to derive a p-value. 

The one-sided (upper) 1-alpha bootstrap percentile CI is [q_alpha, Inf] where q_alpha is the alpha quantile [type=6] of the bootstrap estimates. 

The p-value for H_0: theta=0 vs H_A: theta>0 is thus the value alpha for which q_alpha=0 [or the largest such value if multiple q_alpha=0, or 0 if all bootstrap estimates are > 0, or 1 if all bootstrap estimates are <0]. 

Our current implementation calculates this as p(""greater"") = (sum(est<0)+1)/(length(est)+1)) which I took from [Efron and Tibshirani, 1994, page 214-215; adding +1 to comply with the percentile bootstrap definition of Davison and Hinkley, 1997]. 
I believe, this is exactly correct according to the explanation above if and only if exactly one bootstrap estimate is equal to 0. 
If all bootstrap estimates are !=0 [which is the typical case], I think it is conservative and never off by more than 1/(B+1). As 1/(B+1) is very small for large B, this should not be a practical concern.  
If many bootstrap estimates are exactly = 0 [which should not really occur in practice for reasonable data], then the current calculation is more problematic. In particular, in the extreme case where all bootstrap estimates are exactly = 0, then the current calculation gives p(""greater"")=1/(B+1) which does not make sense. 

Therefore, I have thought about how to improve this to also give correct values in such extreme cases and my current function of creating one-sided p-values is below. Unfortunately, it is more involved than I hoped...
 
The two-sided p-value would be calculated as before with truncation at 1 because it is still possible that both one-sided p-values are >0.5 in case of tied bootstrap estimates at 0. 

I would really appreciate if either of you could think this through again carefully to make sure that I haven't messed anything up and then incorporate it in the next release. Thanks!

```
pval_percentile <- function(est){
  # Determines the (not necessarily unique) quantile (type=6) of ""est"" which gives a value of 0
  # From this, derive the p-value corresponding to the percentile bootstrap via inversion  
  if (all(est==0)){ # non-unqiue solution
    qmin <-0
    qmax <- 1
  } else if (min(est) > 0){ # if 0 below range of est, still give value 0
    qmin <- qmax <- 0 
  } else if (max(est)< 0) { # if 0 above range of est, still give value 1
    qmin <- qmax <- 1 
  } else if (any(est==0)){ # non-unqiue solution if multiple est==0

<!-- Please describe your issue in as much detail as possible-->

# Motivation

Execution environment is a key part of documenting package behaviors. There is no way we can create a singular environment that is representative of all use-cases. Base OS, system dependencies, R build, etc - all effect execution behaviors.

Likewise, if we want to be able to compose with `r-lib/actions`, we likely want to structure our action the same way. That is, the R installation is its own action, which composes as part of a workflow. Most similar to our action would be the [`R CMD check` action](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/master/check-r-package/action.yaml), which makes use of the R installation configured in a previous action in which to run the checks.

# Options/Considerations

1. Clone scripts from the action repo as part of the action? This seems like a hack, but it would be the most straightforward.
2. Composite/shell action that embeds all steps within a `runs:steps:run:` script. 
3. (1) is a bit messy - we could spin up a separate R package to build the actual report such that the contents of the run step would only need to install the package and run a function from it. Shipping the code as an R package, especially one installed as a `github_remote`, is effectively a clone of the script files, but might be more palatable.

Any other suggestions/thoughts?

### Use case:

While creating a release from a non-default branch (eg. `pre-release`), I would create a tag from this branch and assign the tag with a value of `v1.0.0`. While doing so, I have Github Action workflows which are triggered on tag creation and produce artifacts that can be attached to the release (i.e. `v1.0.0`), but the artifacts fail to build successfully.

The artifacts fail to build because, while installing the staged dependencies, the deps are installed from the the default stage (i.e. `main`/`master`), whereas they would have built successfully _if_ the tag had the `@pre-release` suffix in its name.

In this case, I would like to be able to create the tag, but specify in my Github Action workflow that I want to install dependencies from the `pre-release` stage for other repos.

In this case, the user could set a simpler covariance structure for MMRM (but not for the MCMC) using, e.g. `method_bayes(..., init_cov = ""ar1"")`. `method$init_cov` is a parameter that takes the same values as `method$covariance`, but can be specified only for `method_bayes()` and has default value to `""us""`.  By setting `init_cov` differently from `'us'` the user will (1) provide starting values of the MCMC equal to MMRM estimates with simpler covariance structure, and (2) assume that the prior for the covariance matrix is a inverse-wishart distribution with mean equal to a non-unstructured covariance matrix. .

I've been looking through our ADaM template codes starting with ADVS (to help build my own familiarity with the functions) and found few things which Thomas advised I raise an issue for:

- why do we not keep DOMAIN as default as this is a CDISC required variable?
- advs_params gets created adding the new parameter metadata from the lookup but then this doesn't get used as input in the subsequent step (advs gets used), so MAP, BMI and BSA remain with variables like PARAM blank
- something odd happens with derive_var_basetype() step as the dataset goes from 54839 obs to 32824 and we lose some parameters like TEMP completely because of this

Do we have integration testing for these template programs? As that should spot some of these, whereas function-level unit testing only proves each individual function works. I think we discussed adding some integration testing before to compliment this.

Let me know if I could be of use at all here picking up any actions from this issue, e.g. happy to help with setting up some integration test codes.","rossfarrugia",19,9

Trying to generate Kaplan-Meier plot without strata variable.
Expectation is when `strata is NULL` in `estimate_KM` still risk table has to be showed considering for ALL records.
But function `add_risktable` is failing when `strata is NULL` in `estimate_KM`

Same behavior observed when strata column has 1 group only. consider `column SAFFL` has 1 group (Y) only

#### Steps to reproduce the issue
2 examples are provided
1. when strata is NULL
2. when strata column has 1 group only

```r
adtte %>%
    estimate_KM(strata = NULL, conf.int = 0.90) %>%
    visr(legend_position = ""right"", x_unit = ""Days"") %>%
    add_CI(style = ""ribbon"") %>%
    add_CNSR(shape = 3, size = 1) %>%
    add_risktable(
        statlist = c(""n.risk"", ""n.event"", ""n.censor""),
        label = c(""At risk"", ""Event"", ""Censor"")
    )
```

```r
adtte %>%
    estimate_KM(strata = ""SAFFL"", conf.int = 0.90) %>%
    visr(legend_position = ""right"", x_unit = ""Days"") %>%
    add_CI(style = ""ribbon"") %>%
    add_CNSR(shape = 3, size = 1) %>%
    add_risktable(
        statlist = c(""n.risk"", ""n.event"", ""n.censor""),
        label = c(""At risk"", ""Event"", ""Censor"")
    )
```

#### What's the expected result?
Risk table to be showed in the plot
-


#### What's the actual result?
```
Error in data.frame(time = survfit_summary$time, strata = base::factor(.get_strata(survfit_summary[[""strata""]]),  : 
  arguments imply differing number of rows: 11, 0

The `covtracer` output here is pretty generic. We can do some filtering if we want to present other information. By default, `NA`s are included for documented objects that are untested. As well, there may be situations where the `test_name` is unknown, but there is still testing code that prompts package execution (often this is test setup code, outside of any `test_that()` call). 

In the `covtracer` README, I include these columns just to illustrate the missingness of code coverage. In a report, I would choose other, more meaningful columns - I would drop `test_name` and `count`, and instead filter out unexported documentation (`filter(is_exported = TRUE)`) to only show untested, exported functions as those are a better indicator of the user contract of a package. Just for the sake of clarity, it might be nice to have a clean ""No untested behavior"" if the resulting table has no records instead of just showing an empty table.

Currently, the method fails altogether in this setting and this is ok for 99.9% of the cases, as this should be extremely rare. However, it still seems reasonable to build in a relatively conservative handling of this ""worst case scenario"" to avoid complete failure.

My proposal is to:
a) Add a tolerance threshold which by default is 0 but allows up to x% jackknife failures.
b) If the MMRM/estimator fails on a leave-one-subject-out datasets, treat it as follows: 
    - the corresponding draws, imputed dataset and estimators are NA/NULL
    - for the jackknife SE calculation, the estimators for all failed leave-one-out dataset are conservatively set  as equal to the observed estimator amongst all leave-one-out datasets which didn't fail and which had the largest absolute distance to the estimator from the original dataset.

- Create a module (both server and ui part) - modify `shiny/m_tables_dm.R` script.
- Use `sidebarLayout` as in home module.
- Run `t_dm` function on appropriate dataset. (Until the rtables subteam deliver - please use the one in `/programs_final/tables_func/t_dm.R` file)
- Please add three `textInput` elements in the encodings panel to specify `title`, `subtitle` and `footer` arguments respectively.
- Please add download button that downloads paginated rtable.","pawelru",11,10

I want to apply filter and use filtered dataset accross the app modules

Implementation guide:
- Create a module (both server and ui part) - modify `shiny/filter.R` script.
  - UI part
    - add multiple widgets with all levels / range for a given dataset variable.
    - for ADSL: filter on SEX (multichoices radio-button), RACE (same as previously) and AGE (slider).
    - for ADAE: filter on AETERM and ASEQ (both multichoices radio-button)
    - for ADVS: filter on PARAMCD and AVISIT (both multichoices radio-button)
  - server part:
    - apply `dplyr::filter` with choices / range from input for each datasets
    - return a named list with reactive objects containing filtered dataset
    - introduce dependency between datasets so that filtering on demographics variables in ADSL would influence ADAE filitered dataset:
    ```
    ADSL_FILTERED <- dplyr::filter(ADSL, ...)
    ADSL_FILTERED_FINAL <- ADSL_FILTERED
    ADAE_FILTERED <- dplyr::filter(ADAE, ...)
    ADAE_FILTERED_FINAL <- dplyr::inner_join(ADSL_FILTERED, ADAE_FILTERED, ...)
    ADVS_FILTERED <- dplyr::filter(ADVS, ...)
    ADVS_FILTERED_FINAL <- dplyr::inner_join(ADSL_FILTERED, ADVS_FILTERED, ...)
    (return XYZ_FILTERED_FINAL datasets)
    ```
- Note that some logic would be repeated for multiple datasets - using modules could be a good idea to keep the code DRY.

the function derive_last_dose() that I want to use for ADAE fails because I have some medication in EX reported as intervals, i.e. the start and end date are not the same. I can see the problem with a time interval spanning multiple days, but it's not ok that the function stops working completely if something is identified. There can be a note and maybe a parameter saying, use the EXENDTC no matter what (as it is done by STREAM) or exclude multiple day intervals. I would actually only exclude intervals over more than one day. You might have an infusion that starts before midnight and finishes the next day. In that case it's totally fine to use EXENDTC.

Discussion with Kristian below from Slack:

Kristian Trøjelsgaard Nielsen Oct 21st at 2:59 PM
Hi all, just a question for the @channel.
In my company we often link information from different SDTM domains through SDTM.RELREC. As far as I understand RELREC is a an official domain, but how it is used can depend on data collection and maybe also some company specific trends.
We often link auxiliary information in relation to AE’s when crating ADAE (e.g. information about injection site reactions, medication errors, hypersensitivity etc), but we also use RELREC in many other cases.  
From my point of view I think there could be much to gain by having some wrapper functions that could handle these operations.
Therefore, do other companies frequently use RELREC and do you see this linkage between domains as something that could be standardised into one or more functions?

Ross Farrugia  8 days ago
hi Kristian, we do map RELREC as standard in our SDTM but how it's used in analysis is not currently well standardised here or part of our current SAS macro solution for ADAE. i imagine some simple function to connect conmeds with the AE they were given for could be achieved but the exact analysis needs might end up more often being study-specific there. is there anything in the ADaM IG using this? i didn't check

Kristian Trøjelsgaard Nielsen  4 days ago
Dear @Ross Farrugia
Thanks for your input.
Doing a quick search in the ADaM IG I was not able to find anything about RELREC. However, there are a couple of Phuse papers that describes the use of RELREC (although one of them is rather old)
(https://www.pharmasug.org/proceedings/2011/CD/PharmaSUG-2011-CD08.pdf and https://www.lexjansen.com/pharmasug/2017/DS/PharmaSUG-2017-DS09.pdf)
I therefore imagine that some standard could be followed at least when attempting to link some of the more common domains.

Ross Farrugia  4 days ago
@Kristian Trøjelsgaard Nielsen sounds a good potential for a community effort once we open source admiral. there's probably many gaps like this in the ADaM IG where we're all doing our own approaches (even team by team within companies) so i like the idea to attempt to provide something to standardise at least for the more common needs. feel free to raise a Github issue as a placeholder for now for this and let us know if you'd have interest to work on this later.
FYI @Thomas Neitmann @Alice Ehmann in case you have better advice here.

Kristian Trøjelsgaard Nielsen  1 day ago
Again thanks for the feedback @Ross Farrugia. I think we will most likely try to implement something like this at my organization so we might as well try to design a solution that could feed into Admiral if that is wanted . So yes, I would have the interest to work on this.

Ross Farrugia  1 day ago
absolutely, this is our vision. we're currently working up the process we will follow around contributions, so expect to see this as part of our open source release

I have a better sense of the intent and design of the package. I like how it standardizes the final report, nudges the user to confront requirements and risk assessments, and explicitly links requirements to test cases.

However, I did feel friction when it came to setting up validation workspaces. `valtools` creates a unique, complicated, multi-level directory structure of files, many of which need to be edited by hand. Because of this and #214, I found myself constantly attending to a mental model of the file space, which competed in my brain for the attention I was trying to pay to the iterative process of writing requirements and rendering the final report.

What considerations led to the current design choices? Besides the current helpers for creating files, are there other ways to increase encapsulation and help users like me trust the current abstraction?

IMHO, R Markdown really excels when it simplifies file system. [`fusen`](https://thinkr-open.github.io/fusen/) and [R Markdown driven development](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/rmarkdown-driven-development/) are the best examples I know.
